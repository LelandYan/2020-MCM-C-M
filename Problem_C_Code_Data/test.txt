__label__5 Man, let me tell ya, this thing really blows; and I mean that in a good way.<br />Buy one, it will blow you away..lol This Thing Blows
__label__5 I have owned this dryer for two and a half years and it still work perfectly.<br /><br />All dryers seem to be the same with a fan, a heating element a stay cool body and some controls. This one has a powerful heating element (1875 watts), and a good fan (for its size). The purpose of a hair dryer is not to heat up the hair to boil away the water, but to speed up the evaporation process of drying by exposing the hair to a stream of hot air. The faster the stream and the warmer the air, the more evaporation occurs.  Where this dryer differs is in the body that has a longer and narrower nozzle that is about one inch wide. This forces a much stronger blast of air (at least on high speed) that is not a wide as those dryers with a wide nozzle.<br /><br />If your hair is fine, colored, permed or naturally curly, you would want a different dryer with a wider nozzle to diffuse the heat so that the hair dries more slowly at a cooler temperature. That may make the hair less likely to frizz and it may give the hair more volume.<br /><br />This dryer makes the nozzle narrow and thus helps to concentrate the heat into one spot in order to make the hair it blows on dry rapidly. You can adjust the fan speed and the temperature, but not the concentration of the air flow.<br /><br />So, if you have regular hair or (like me) are a guy that just wants to dry their hair rapidly, this is the dryer for you. Put it on high speed and high heat and it is extremely fast. Why this dryer is good for most people
__label__5 This is all I had hoped it would be. It has great power and it is the nice compact small size I desired. Great Hair Dryer
__label__1 I bought two of these dryers.  The first popped, sparked and flashed out of the box.  The second developed the same problem within a week.  Frankly, they are dangerous.  Steer clear. Switch Failure and Sparks
__label__5 I have nothing but good review of this product. <br />Great product at a great price. Conair Soft Bonnet Hair Dryer
__label__1 I know there have been a lot of positive reviews on this hairdryer but the one that I purchased just &#34;blew up&#34;.  Purchased in February of 2015 and can no longer use it in the end of May 2015 (three months).  My girlfriend and myself were using it daily for the three months but I would think it would last longer than that.  Trying to reach out to the manufacturer now to get replaced but this is a hassle that I don't want to deal with.<br /><br />If we get it replaced, I'll change my rating Blew Up in Three Months
__label__2 This is just like the one I have. According to the discription in the ad by Amazon, it was suppose to be light weight. But I was disappointed when it arrived, because it weighed more it was discribed. This is just like the one I have
__label__3 I'm surprised at all the fantastic reviews. It's fine, it works (so far, we'll see), but there is nothing outstanding or amazing about this dryer. It is not faster than any previous dryer I've used, my hair isn't softer or fancier. I do appreciate the ability to set to cool without holding down the button. So, it is what it is and comes with a fair price. Take it or leave it. It's fine, nothing special.
__label__5 I am in hair school and his dryer is perfect! Works perfectly, the best dryer out there for sure. I love it. best dryer!
__label__1 I happened to notice that the base and the handle has dozens upon dozens of cracks in the finish. It looks awful. This product is less than a year old. I have had other hairdryers for years and years with no problems. Since I didn't notice the cracks within the one month return policy, I cannot even return the product. Since I don't dry my hair with my glasses on, I guess I lose out by not noticing this flaw within the return policy period. If you don't care how awful the dryer looks after it has been used, this is the product for you. It's a great product but it now looks terrible. The folks at Conair really should step up to the problem and make things right with the consumers. Finish on Handle and Base Cracks But Not Soon Enough to Return
__label__5 Im a dude first off. At first I thought it was real heavy then I got used to it however this is my first hair dryer as I am growing my hair longer. Ladies beware of the weight however it drys my hair very quickly its about 4 in all the way around right now and takes about 30sec tops completely dry. When you buy it there is multiple settings you just have to play with the two switches that flip up and down. NOT PICTURED IT COMES WITH A FUNNEL AND THE FUNNEL WITH THE COMB ON BOTH SIDES!!!!!!!!<br />Im 1 for 1<br />Take my advice at your own risk. Im a dude first off. At first I thought ...
__label__5 I bought this same dryer 8 years ago and absolutely loved it.  When friends would use it, they'd always wanted to know where I got it but it had been so long that I forgot.  When it blew out (because I dropped the power cord hard on the floor for many'o years) I knew I had to replace it.  I searched for it on Amazon and sure enough, they had it and you can't beat the price.  It's quiet and does a great job on long hair. Quiet and powerful
__label__5 Love this powerful dryer.  It's pretty heavy duty, and it's a little heavier in weight than any other dryer I've had.  But it has the cool setting medium heat and High fast dry mode.  Pretty loud, but what hair dryer isn't it?  It smoothes the hair too , removing the frizz.  Combine with correct hairbrush and you will have salon results! Drys hair fast
__label__2 WHEN USING HIGH SPEED SETTING. ORDERED &#62;&#62; Vidal Sassoon VS783 1875-Watt&#60;&#60; THAT HAS A LOT OF POWER ON HIGH SPEED SETTING. NO POWER
__label__5 I hope that Amazon fixed their search suggestions after I had to return this one with the related comments.<br />My wife loved it and has a similar but older model drier that still works ( for 5 years, I think).<br /><br />Anyway, I was looking for 220 Volt drier and had to return this one in the end Great hair drier. Too bad it comes in a search for 220V hair drier or 220 volt hair drier
__label__5 Product is light and powerful.  It is also very quiet.  This is a huge improvement over my last hair dryer Shipped fast
__label__4 works great, sometimes cord re winder does not rewind all the way which can be a little frustrating. I had a model similar that lasted many years so when it died I bought this and it works the same and has the same issues with the cord winder. However I still like it very much as it does blow alot of air which is why bought it again. Conair 1875 watt
__label__1 After 3 1/2 months after purchasing this hair dryer, the unit has burned out.  This was not the first time I have experienced this same problem with this same dryer.  A year ago I purchased the same dryer and the had the same problem.  Would I ever buy another Andis product...NO! Disappointed Andis Purchaser
__label__4 retractable cord doesn't always retract but I didn't buy it for that. <br />Very happy with the way it dries my hair. product good
__label__4 Bought this dual voltage drier for my trip to Europe. Dried my hair quickly, was compact for travel, used low setting only based on prior reviews. Great dryer but LOUD! loud but dries fast
__label__5 I not always that I would find a blow dryer for this price and it gets as hot as this one. It does wonders with my daughters very natural hair. I love it and would recommend it to everyone. Very satisfied
__label__5 I purchased this hair dryer because it was dual voltage, and I wished to use it in both the United Kingdom and France.  It has an American plug, but with a convertor for each country it worked wonderfully!  I could not be happier with this purchase.  Turns out we went to Italy too, and with the same French convertor, the dryer worked in Italy too. but with a convertor for each country it worked wonderfully! I could not be happier with this purchase
__label__5 awesome hair dryer,this is not a cheap one from your local variety store,well built works great worth every pennie and then some,GREAT BUY. hair dryer
__label__4 I have only used it once but it was quiet. Didn't feel too hot or blow too forcefully. I still had to use a curling iron briefly to curl short hair which slipped through. Dried hair in good time (I have a bob). I liked the reviews it got and was from Japan. Took  a while to figure out some pictures which were not explained on the English page. I am happy with it. None available.
__label__5 Thank you for the great product, and the wonderful samples for tanning.  I now know where to go to purchase products such as this...  Nice touch Rain
__label__5 Fast and helpful used them before would use them again I choose them over my pro distributer that all folks Quick
__label__5 I really like th hair dryer! It drys fast and makes my hair look great! Highly recommended! Five Stars
__label__5 I love this. My mom got it for me for Christmas and it's definitely one of the best Christmas gifts I've ever gotten. Peopel complained that it didn't have a medium setting but I personally didn't see a need for it. I use it for my hot oil treatments and my deep conditioning treatments it works great. It doesn't burn my neck or ears. I would definitely reccomed PERFECT PURCHASE
__label__4 I've had this hair dryer for about a month, it is very powerfull, I have a lot of hair and this hair dryer dries my hair very very fast Powerfull
__label__1 We were traveling and used one of these wall mounted hair driers at a hotel. We loved how the product worked so, once home, we purchased one.    Well, the product switch failed in the first 4 months and we contacted the manufacturer. They were nice enough and had us ship it back and sent us a warranty replacement right away. The replacement lasted about the same amount of time, and has the same failure, the switch went bad.     For the low price of the product $23.00 I don't think it's worth sending a second one back for warranty replacement. Shipping two units back is going to cost more than the original product.    Really nice item, I wish that they made it of quality parts I would surely pay 2-3 times the price to get one that will last longer than a couple of months.    Stay away from this item, seems like they have a design flaw in it. Two with the same switch failure in the same amount of time? Great product/Poor Quality
__label__5 If you really want to dry your hair quickly then this is the dryer you're looking for. It gets very hot and I LOVE IT! It is good for my hair (I have very thick curly and frizzy). Awesome!!
__label__5 Tried this blow dryer at a hotel, went to my iPhone and ordered it immediately. I have long, curly hair and even on the slow speed, it dries my hair fast with less frizz. Andres 82005
__label__5 It is in use every day.  There are currently few quality hair dryers in existence; this is definitely one of them. Good quality hair dryer.
__label__5 I argued with my lady about buying this hair dryer. I told her there were others, others less expensive, that would do the job. It is after all just  drying hair. After buying and trashing a Conair I finally bought her this Turbo Power dryer. THe complants stopped, the dryer still works and I am her hero. The rewards were worth the investment. It works without complaints
__label__5 This is my second purchase of this dryer the first one lasted for about 10 years.  The newer model is great I would highly recommend it as I have to many friends. Great Dryer
__label__5 Searched high and low for a good quality,  stylish and affordable hair dryer. This is perfect....<br />I've had it a while now (over a year) and I am still happy to have found this.  I really love the folding handle and retracting cable with the push of a button - allows me to pack it away nice and easily.  Everything else works as described. Stylush & affordable
__label__5 It works great! The dial for timing it's backwards but it works just fine. Five Stars
__label__5 Have owned a few hair dryers and this one has definitely been my favorite.  Provides adequate fan power and heat while the overall design seems solid.  The cool setting provides a nice little gush of cooler air and the folding ability has been pretty handy (albeit mainly handy for going on trips).  The attachments it comes with also work pretty nicely and fit pretty snug.  Have had this for more than a year now with no problems as everything is still operating perfectly.  Would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a solid and well priced hair dryer. An overall great buy at an affordable cost
__label__5 This is the best blow dryer ever. Gets super hot I was using The Chi deep brilliance dryer for my Dominican blowouts which was good but this twin turbo cuts my blowouts to half the time and gets far more straighter with just the blow dryer. You've got my vote. Beyond great
__label__4 Green is my favorite color and I love them as nail polishes. Who the Shrek are you is a very unique color that you won't find anywhere else.<br />The application was OK but not great: i thought the polish was a little thin and I had to use 3 coats.<br />However, I first fell in love with this color when i got it for a manicure (picture included) and I only had 2 coats on.<br />You will not regret having this color in your closet, it is perfect for summer! Fun and lovely color!
__label__4 the cord is too long.  if the cord had a spiral or curled design, it would be  a lot easier to use and take up less space. almostt great
__label__5 This hair dryer is the best !!  I have very long hair and it dries my hair in minuets.  It used to take me 20 minuets to dry my hair.  Now with this great dryer it only takes me minuets.  This saved a lot of time in the morning.  I can dry my bangs in seconds. They come out perfect every time. Great Buy !!
__label__1 It was great when it worked, but it went completely dead without any warnings in less than 12 months.  So that speaks so much about its quality. Went completely dead in less than 12 months
__label__5 This is an amazingly sturdy and powerful hair dryer.  Really dries my hair quickly and allows for easy styling.  This one should last me a long time. Awesome!
__label__4 It works for me well because I have thin hair, if you have thick hair or very long hair, you will spend five hours with it. It works well and is very comfortable. Good Stuff
__label__3 Had this for about two years and the bearings have already started to fail. Makes more noise than when new. It's ok... but not great. it's ok...
__label__1 Malfunctioned!  Ordered this blowdryer in March 2015 for occasional use at home (I am a guy with short hair - so I barely use it daily).  It malfunctioned only THREE months later in June 2015.  I was drying my hair one morning and flames shot from the dryer at my head - I did not get burned (nor did my hair) but it was pretty surreal to see the dryer nearly on fire.  Unfortunately, they are no longer available - I have no way to contact the seller and so I am stuck buying another dryer. I have included a picture to show the extent of the glowing fire at the end of this dyer.  Buy this Allure hair dryer at your own risk!  If the seller reads this review - I would appreciate being contacted for replacement.  Thanks! Caught Fire During Use after 3 Months!
__label__4 Very powerful on High setting.  Needs a middle setting though.  Rocker switch very hard to move accurately from one setting to another, but maybe that will improve with use.  Shot of cool air feature is helpful and hair dries quickly with smooth finish.  I rarely use my full sized Chi dryer as the size, power and weight make this my go to dryer. That said, I haven't used this for international travel so cannot vouch for other features.  Overall a great value for the price! Better than the Big Girl
__label__5 Small, light in weight & easy to use. It does the job & I love it! No Whimpy Hotel Dryer...
__label__1 Died after only a dozen or less uses.  Smoke and electrical smell from unit. Short lived
__label__5 I had a hair dryer with a retractable cord back in the mid 80s and I've been looking for a replacement to love as much as I loved that one ever since it died after 7 years of service. This is an excellent hair dryer that gives a good flow of air. I don't like a dryer that gets too hot, and I was pleased that even the high setting doesn't get so hot that I feel like it's trying to bake my hair rather than dry it. The low setting is great for setting my wavy hair during the final moments of drying. It has a good weight that is substantial without being cumbersome and a good-sized grip. My hair is prone to static and this unit doesn't induce that unpleasant state. I had high expectations for the Andis RC-2 Ionic1875W Ceramic Hair Dryer with Folding Handle and Retractable Cord and it didn't disappoint me. A great dryer for wavy hair
__label__1 I used this type of dryer at my brother's house and recall it feeling powerful and pretty hot, even at a low setting - exactly what I was looking for in a new dryer.    Then i ordered one for myself and got a fairly crappy dryer that didn't get warm enough at a low speed setting and didn't feel powerful at all... My only impression is disappointment. I would not recommend this dryer for anyone looking for a quality dryer. Pretty Disappointing
__label__5 Make your hair soft, frizz free. My daughter has very thick fine hair. It does a wonderful job. Highly recommend. HSI professional Hair dryer
__label__4 I used this hairdryer while on a trip to Ireland.  While it's true that you only get one functioning speed when using the dryer with 240 volts, the speed you have is very powerful.  I stayed at a number of hotels that had dryers available, but in most cases, I used this one instead.  This gave me the convenience of using it anywhere in the room and had more power than those supplied by the hotels.  It is very light weight and compact for packing.  I would definitely recommend this to others who want to be certain they have a functioning hair dryer while in European countries without having to purchase and take the risk of using a convertor.  A plug adapter is still necessary.  A simple turn of a screw using your fingernail changes the dryer from 120-240 volts. Worked better than many of the hotel hair dryers.
__label__1 Used it three times and it died! One Star
__label__5 Works great Five Stars
__label__1 This hair dryer was a waste of money.<br /><br />The cord is far too short for proper styling unless you are standing within 2 feet of power socket.<br /><br />The warm setting is cool<br /><br />On the hot setting Only the inner part of the dryer blows hot hair and the outer rim is cool air which makes the hot setting basically a warm.<br /><br />Very disappointed- I would pay 15-20 for this as my local CVS. Cheap hair dryer with no power
__label__5 Love it. Powerful and totally worth the price. Dries my hair in half the time. Great product
__label__3 Other than that it's fine. I have one other minor objection. I mounted mine in the leg well under the dressing area on the left side. There one can see the led light leaking out the bottom of the cabinet and not just through the bezel that it is supposed to. the light leak is something I could fix with RTV silicon, I just haven't bothered. A better design would include a case that fits better to it's base and doesn't leak light, and would also only have the light on when it's dark instead of all the time. Again, it's not quiet. We bought it for our guest bath, so as much as our guests stay here they shouldn't go deaf. No way I'd put up with this noise if it was our primary. This unit doesn't deserve to call itself quiet, so if you need quiet keep shopping. This unit is no quieter than any other hair dryer I've heard except when it's off
__label__4 Great amount of air flow. Could be a little hotter though. Overall, not a bad hair dryer. Very light and easy to handle. Very Good
__label__4 Works great!  Does what it is supposed to do and is compact and easy to use with good features too Good Product
__label__5 I purchased this to replace my old Conair folding handle dryer. That one was a bit more compact, which I liked, but this one isn't bulky and works really well. I appreciate the ability to control both the temperature and speed of the air. I would definitely recommend it. Solid hair dryer
__label__5 I think pretty much all has been said in the above reviews. It dries hair quickly, but doesn't damage it by being too hot, nor does it make it frizzy. It is not too loud - it is not exactly quiet, but nothing dramatic. It is not too heavy either. And it's a good deal! I have had it since a month and I actually go through the trouble of blowdrying my hair much more often now, because my hair looks so nice now. (Well, not that I was a monster before). A really good hairdryer for reasonable price
__label__5 My husband continues to tease me because I continue to gush about how much I love this blow dryer. He says ooooh - it plugs in and blows air - how special (says the man with little hair to blow :) This is a great dryer - I have longish straight hair - and it dries it in a heartbeat without frying my hair - the variety of settings really work well - and the cool shot button is instantaneous. My hair hasn't looked this good in years! Superior Dryer!
__label__5 I place my order on Wednesday September 1st and I was shocked that I already got it today September 4th; I am very pleased with them because I need it the item right away and I got it without paying extra money for rush delivery.  I won't think twice to buy again from them and I Would definately recomend them to everybody.  Excellent Packing and professionally well done.   TWO THUMBS UP AND FIVE STARS. EXCELENT SERVICE
__label__2 I bought this a little over a year ago, used it 5 to 6 times a week to dry my short hair, and kept the dust/lint trap clean regularly. Loved this dryer and it dried my hair quickly. However, after barely a year, suddenly it blew nothing hotter than luke-warm air. I put up with this for a couple of weeks until one day it blew only cold air. Very disappointing, as I'd really liked everything else about this dryer. It's now been replaced with a lesser but more dependable brand until I can find something comparable. Look elsewhere or expect a limited product lifespan. Worked great...for about a year
__label__5 Very convenient and portable. This dryer has the perfect temperature settings and is long lasting. Portable and Reliable
__label__4 But I forgot to change the voltage switch.  So sad. So sad.
__label__3 I liked the hairdryer, I wish it was a little more powerful, but it did get the job done and was easy to use dry hair
__label__4 It's very cute and light on the pockets, I'm loving it soo far. It's a thumbs up for me!<br />Don't overthink it, Just get it! Just Perfect
__label__5 I've had this hairdryer for years now and it works just as well as it did the day I bought it. High-powered and hot, which creates the perfect blowout with or without a round brush. I really love this hair-dryer, and I take it with me whenever I travel.<br /><br />Update--- 2 years post review and it's still going strong! Once you get a Twin Turbo, there's no going back!
__label__4 I needed to replace my professional-grade hair dryer, and I was considering all my options. I wasn't sure that I wanted to spend a significant amount of money, so I tried this model, which had fairly good reviews.<br /><br />It's fairly quiet. It is not as powerful as my old dryer, but it is significantly lighter and seems to be constructed well. So far, so good. Good, Affordable Hair Dryer
__label__5 I really like this little hair dryer, and it is all that I really need.  I have long hair but it can be totally dry in 5 minutes with this unit! Andis Micro Turbo
__label__5 I am very happy so far with this dryer.  The controls are easy to manipulate, even while drying and styling.  The slight downward tilt is actually genius as it is more ergonomic than regular dryers.  And the company, XTAVA, has reached out to me, expressing their desire that I am happy with their product and to please let them know if I have questions.  I find this very refreshing and impressive. I am very happy so far with this dryer
__label__4 I like this hair dryer a lot.  It does dry my hair faster and it is quieter compared to my old 30 dollar dryer.  The only con is that it is heavier than my old dryer.  I'm a little concerned about how it was packaged.  It looks like the item was opened and then repackaged.  Each piece inside the box was repackaged and closed with twisty ties.  Hopefully I won't have any problems with it and it will last.  I would recommend this dryer to anyone who has thick hair and a lot of it! Mom2Jonah
__label__5 Infinity by Conair Mighty Mini Blow Dryer is awesome! It's so small and lightweight I forget I'm holding a blow dryer!<br />Don't be fooled by the small appearence, you'll definitely get much bang for your buck with this one! I have long curly tresses and it drys my hair lickidy split.<br />Would Absolutely recommend to a friend (and to a complete stranger too)! Infinity by Conair Mighty Mini Blow Dryer
__label__5 When I first opened this hair dryer, I was quite dismayed!  It was much smaller than I expected - so small in fact that I doubted that it would work at all.  Last night I washed my hair and decided to try out this &#34;mini toy&#34;.  I was truly amazed;  while it didn't dry my hair quite as quickly as my large tourmaline dryer, it worked nearly as quickly.  For travel, you can't go wrong with this dryer! It Looks Like a Toy, but
__label__1 I purchased a hairdryer for over $100 from this vendor in Jan 2009.  I filled out all the warranty forms and submitted to T3 as expected. Now it's October of 2011 and it is already breaking. I was sold a POS! So when I contacted the manufacturer about the dryer no longer functioning properly, they responded via email that this vendor AND Amazon.com are not an authorized resellers of T3 products and my dryer is not covered under the warranty. Now I am royally hosed.   I highly suggest NOT purchasing any products that may require a warranty fix from any vendor like this. Buyer beware - NOT AN AUTHORIZED T3 Reseller
__label__1 I purchased this item less than 3 months ago. After using the product for about 4 weeks, I noticed that the handle got incredibly hot...too hot for me to hold without it burning my hand. Today, less than 12 weeks after purchasing, the hair dryer started smoking and completely shut down. Needless to say, I am very disappointed. I am very disappointed.
__label__5 I hairdresser recommended this blow dryer to me she said it was the strongest and best she has ever used, she was right.  I'm pretty sure they use this blow dryer in the movie Twister to make the tornadoes. Powerful
__label__4 I was skeptical about buying such an expensive hair dryer. However, my best friend had one and I tried it on a trip. I thought I liked it but still wasn't sure about spending the money. My stylist let one of the other girls dry my hair one day. She used one when drying my hair. I commented on how soft and smooth my hair was. I usually get my hair flat ironed to get the same effect. She didn't have to. I called my girlfriend to see if her hair dryer was the same brand and it was. So I bought one. I love it and haven't flat ironed my hair yet! The only thing I was dissapointed in was that the warranty doesn't apply to the purchases from Amzon. I just hope it lasts for a long time so I don't feel cheated. Overall I am very impressed. I didn't realize that a hair dryer can make such a difference in your hair. I say go for it! Overall Impressed
__label__5 This hair dryer was perfect for my needs, and the pricing didn't hurt anything either! I am MORE than satisfied! 2 thumbs up all around! Exactly as advertised
__label__5 I travel a lot and this blow dryer folds down to fit nicely in my luggage. It's powerful and drys my hair quickly without &#34;frying&#34; it. I've tried more expensive models (both Andis models and other manufacturers) but I keep coming back to this blow dryer because it simply performs better than all others. Great Blowdryer that Travels Well
__label__5 Oozes quality. Easy to maneuver to any direction. Relatively quiet and extra long cord. i really have been spoiled by it! It blew me away!!!
__label__3 It's an ok drier but there are so many better options out there with a stronger motor. The airflow is weak even on the highest setting. It says its a 1875w drier but it dries the hair more like a 1200w one. Also it is quite bulky. It does reduce frizz and improve the shine.<br /><br />I recommend it to a person with short and fine hair. If you have coarse or curly hair, I wouldn't pick this one. It's an ok drier but there are so many better options out there with a stronger motor
__label__1 I had the same problem as other reviews. After the first use, the dryer stopped blowing hot air. Such a disappointment. Especially since the one time I used it, it did an amazing job. Disappointing
__label__5 I love this hair dryer.  I bought the travel size and a local Ulta.  I immediately loved it.  Drys my hair fast and doesn't fry it. Would recommend it. The Best
__label__5 This is the only brand I trust. I tried many many hairdryers, and they all stop working as soon as returning is not an option. This hairdryer is the last one you will ever need. It has two settings high/low, and it just works. Awesome!
__label__3 This hair dryer is just alright. I have fine wavy hair, but a lot of it, and needed a hair dryer with a diffuser. After looking through reviews I decided to purchase this one over some cheaper models or buying the same Vidal Sassoon model I've owned for many years.<br />My first impression was that I was shocked by how heavy it was, because it's ceramic. It can be sort of awkward to use before you get used to it. Secondly, the difference between the &#34;warm&#34; to the &#34;hot&#34; setting is pretty big. The &#34;warm&#34; on mine has barely more heat than the &#34;cool&#34; setting and the &#34;hot&#34; setting is too hot to use for more than a minute or two. The &#34;hot&#34; also makes my hair super frizzy, but that's fixed by blasting it on the &#34;cool&#34; setting after the heat. But I do worry that it damages my hair. I would use the &#34;warm&#34; setting if it didn't take so long.<br />This hair dryer is kept at my boyfriend's and I only use it to dry the roots of my hair with the diffuser to give them lift, so it doesn't see much use. Because I don't use it often I can get over the negatives of the dryer and it is alright for me. If I had to use it every day or dried more than the roots of my hair I would return it. Works for small jobs
__label__1 The box to the dryer was open it was missing the coupon that it was supposed to include. It might have been used. It was definitely opened... box was open
__label__5 this works great, was brand new in the box, I used all the time.  I was very happy with this product dryer
__label__4 This was bought to replace the same unit that had mysteriously stopped working after several years of heavy use. Obviously we like the performance and convienience of a wall mounted blow dryer. Nothing fancy, but handy. Replacement Unit
__label__5 good power Five Stars
__label__5 LOVE IT LEFT MY HAIR SOOOOOOO BEAUTIFUL LIKE IN THE SALON<br />DOES NOT OVER HEAT<br />AND ITS SMALL LIGHTWEIGH POWERFUL BUT DONT LET THE SIZE AND WEIGHT MISGUIDE YOU ITS A POWERFUL THING LIKE A PLANE OR CAR OR BOAT....LOVE IT. I USE IT ON MY HAIR ON M MOMS HAIR ON MY COUSINS HAIR AND ON MY SISTERS HAIR AND ON MY 2 DOGS HAIR I WOULD USE IT ON MY DADS HAIR BUT HES BALD LOL LOVE IT.... GET IT ASAP YOU CANT GO WRONG THE BEST DRYER EVER OMG ITS THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!
__label__3 It looks great on the wall, but just isn't very powerful. Takes much longer to dry my hair, wish I had known. Hair dryer
__label__5 How great can a hair dryer be?  Aren't they all the same?  Well, as is true with many things, all hair dryers are not created equal, and this was a GREAT find.  It seems a simple thing -- just turn it on and dry the hair -- but I've been frustrated many times with hair dryers that are too strong, blowing like a hurricane no matter what the setting, too weak, barely putting out a cough of air, or too cold, or too hot, or that just fry themselves after a few months of use.  And, specifically, I wanted a travel hair dryer, since my last supposed &#34;dual voltage&#34; hair dryer went up in smoke (literally!) when trying to use it on the other voltage setting.  So, this hair dryer has been a welcome treat.  Not only does it do as it claims, in being dual voltage, but you still got low and high settings, and the great &#34;cool shot&#34; at either voltage setting.  Air flow and heat are consistent and the low and high settings are really just that -- less heat and air, or more heat and air -- and are noticeable in difference.  Comes with two attachments, as shown, handle folds, plus the back opens up for cleaning!  I have never found such a great hair dryer at even far higher prices, let alone at the great price for this one!  If you're looking for a great hair dryer that also can travel the world with you, this one is the one! The perfect hair dryer?
__label__4 I purchased this blow dryer to replace one that had gone out on me...The dryer that was sent to me must be a new version of the same product...It is now a black/purple dryer versus the red one pictured.  Although I got a little excited when I opened the box (black and purple are my favorite colors,) once I turned on the dryer, I felt the difference.  It doesn't have as much power as my old dryer.  The &#34;turbo&#34; on the old one felt like I was in a wind storm, which is exactly what it takes to dry my long hair.  On the new version, there is hardly any &#34;blow&#34; on the regular setting, and the &#34;turbo&#34; setting only increases it a little.  My quest for a fast dry time blow dryer continues.... Good product, but not thrilled with the new version
__label__5 I bought this dryer to replace my Conair Nano Silver Tourmaline, which I loved dearly.  I've tried a number of other Conair dryers, and none of them got quite hot enough, so I figured I'd give this one a try.    My hair: mid-back, quite thick, wavy/curly and frizz prone.  I usually dry it straight with a round brush instead of flat ironing, so I need a dryer that gets very hot.    Things I like about the dryer:    1. Great heat settings.  My old dryer went from hot to scalding.  This one blows truly cold air for the cool shot, cool air on low, warm on warm, and scalding on hot.  I was surprised by how well it dried my hair on warm (I usually use the highest setting the whole time), but I did need to use the hottest setting to get my hair straight.  This dryer gets hotter than anything I've tried in this price range, which for me is a huge plus.    2. Relatively quiet.  It sounds like a hair dryer, but is considerably quieter than any other product I've tried.      3. Good weight/feel.  Other reviewers have said it's heavy, but at least compared to the other Conair dryers I've used, I'd say it's about the same, maybe lighter.  Definitely not a problem unless you're used to a really, really lightweight dryer.  The surface is nice and grippy, and the balance feels good.    Overall, I'm very satisfied.  It dried my hair quickly, can attain the heat I need (but doesn't limit you to scaldingly hot), and didn't cost an arm and a leg.  Highly recommended! Great hairdryer for the price
__label__3 I am super picky about my hair dryers.  And while this is not the best one I've ever had (my favorite was an 1875 watt Helen of Troy Professional that died several years ago), it's not bad.  Unfortunately, in this day and age, the only dryers I can seem to find are ionic ones.  For me ionic dryers = flat hair.  So, with the choices so limited, this dryer is decent.  I wish it had slow fan speed with high heat, but I can't be too choosy at this point. Not bad dryer, especially when all they make are ionics
__label__1 it's not working, never stay on the mirror. Falls down all the time in few hours, and it broke my large mirror last time. I hate it, and I am not going to use it. it's not working, never stay on the mirror, fall don, and it broke my large mirror last time
__label__5 I had recently been on vacation, and the hotel had this hair dryer in their bathrooms.  I liked it so much I decided I wanted one for my bathroom, found it, and purchased it!  I have no regrets.<br /><br />First of all I love the convenience of having it mounted within easy reach.  I am always running late, so being able to grab and dry is wonderful.  It is a powerful little dryer and dries my hair quickly.<br /><br />I know others complain about the nightlight... in the beginning it seemed bright so I would simply pull the bathroom door to.  Now I don't even notice it!<br /><br />If you're looking for something efficient, practical and convenient, this is the little dryer for you! Powerful Little Dryer
__label__2 Worked great.  Love the retractable cord.  Then one day, just 10 months after buying it, it just wouldn't turn on.  I had to throw it in the trash.  My last hair dryer lasted years and years.  This sucks. Stopped working after 10 months
__label__5 This dryer definitely lives up to its claims.  As an African American who has natural hair, I was looking for a product that would not dry-out my hair.  The technology of this dryer not only dries my hair quickly, but also leaves it hydrated with lots of moisture.  I use this for my daughter's hair as well, who has thick, coarse hair.  This dryer also provides moisture and helps with the manageability of her hair. I strongly recommend this product. Strongly Recommend
__label__4 Good hair dryer for use with the big curlers. A longer hose would have been good. It holds you hostage while you dry. Good days
__label__5 good product, very easy to install. Don't use the screw provided instead by special drywall screws otherwise we are very happy with this product. mounted hair dryer
__label__5 I have had my dryer for over a year now and have had no problems with it. It works as well now as it did when I received it. It is not too noisy and it is light weight enough for me (I hate a heavy dryer). It is a full size dryer , not a travel size, and it dries my hair quickly.  I like that it has 2 blow settings and 3 heat settings.  It is easy to change settings while drying.  I use it everyday....so it has had a real workout.. Love this dryer
__label__5 For just $7.99 & FREE Shipping (without even buying over $35.00) this is another very best buy, praise the Lord! Sturdy, powerful, and comes with 2 attachments (that I don't need), and the lowest price anywhere online (or anywhere I know of ) for this level of dryer/blower. It has two speeds with low and high heat, and a cool switch, which, like other ones i have tried  still blows some warm air, not the ambient temp.     These run off 120v AC,  which is needed for the heating element, though  I assume that like other ones  inside is a 12v DC blower motor. These likely do not cost much to make, but some can be very expensive. Why pay more? A very best buy at $7.99 & FREE Shipping, PTL
__label__5 Why does this little compact travel dryer work better than my bigger more expensive hair dryer? Which I've put away in the guest bathroom. This is a great little dryer. I wish it had a quick cool shot button, but I wouldn't avoid buying it for that reason. Better than a Big Dryer
__label__5 I love this hairdryer, but for some people, they may not be completely ecstatic with the settings of this hairdryer.  WIth this hairdryer, you cannot really control the temperature of the air, only how intense the air flows from the dryer.  The only way to change the temperature of the air is to press the blue button on the hair dryer to make the air cooler.  Other than that side note, I love the color of the hairdryer and how quickly it dries my hair (my hair is long and it takes about 15 minutes to blow dry my hair). Cute hairdryer!
__label__3 The dryer works just fine but the switches are ill-designed. The switches are located in an awkward position.    First:  the blue cool button is where your fingers rest so when you are drying hair and easily rest your fingers on the cool button, you blast the dryer on the cool setting.  This is very annoying and you have to get used to not pressing this button.    Second:  in order to turn on /off the dryer and turn the setting to how you want, you have to get used to doing it from an awkward position in the back of the handle where your fingers are holding the dryer.  Once you get used to it, it's not a big deal, but it's constantly annoying trying to turn on/off the dryer from this position.    The power of the dryer is great; it's powerful and the dryer works well but I wish the buttons were designed better so that I didn't always hit the cool button and that the on/off switch were easier to turn the blower on and off. Hair dryer
__label__5 This Pro Bonnet Style Dryer shipped fast from the seller and was easy to assemble.  It is whisper quiet and does a great job drying hair evenly.  I recommend this product. I love it
__label__4 I purchased this dryer at the recommendation of my stylist.  I have THICK, curly hair that takes hours to dry.  I let my hair air-dry because conventional blowdryers (even with a diffuser) only add frizz and uncurl my spiral curls.  Having a wet head for hours in the winter is uncomfortable.  This dryer is fabulous.  I can dry my hair while working at my home office.  The results have been terrific.  I read the other reviews before purchasing, and use the pole and casters to move it to the appropriate spot.  So far, so good. Fabulous dryer
__label__5 LOVE this hair dryer.  My hair used to take forever to dry and this does the job in half the time if not less.  My hair always feels nice and soft after I am finished drying it and is not frizzy.  A huge improvement over my $20 hairdryer from Target. Super Fast!!
__label__5 This is my second version of this hair dryer.  The first one I used for several years and it finally gave up the ghost.  I like the fact that it folds to a small size and it gets hot enough to actually style my hair.  I hope this one lasts as long as the first one.  I have had a couple of travel hair dryers, but this one is better by far.  One good feature is this one does not have such a loud, high pitched scream as most small hair dryers.  The cold air button is also a BIG plus, since I use that when styling my hair with a round brush.  Overall, this is a great product. Easy to pack
__label__5 I use to buy the department store regular hair dryers and my hair was never as smooth as I want, I had to flat iron a lot. This dryer is amazing. Takes all the work out of blow drying. You can see the steam of water as you dry. Be careful it is high heat, but will dry your hair in half the time and you need very little flat ironing. AMAZING
__label__5 We have 3 of these, one in each bathroom. They are great and hold up to moderate usage very good. Great Product
__label__5 This is an item that my girlfriend requested on her wishlist, and i got it for her. She loves it, and apparently it is amazing. I am bald now, so I have no need for such things, but it's nice to know I bought her something that is great at drying the hair one might have. Christmas gift score!
__label__5 Hang up wall mounted hair dryer fit right in the spot the old dryer was mounted. Powerful enough... i choice this particular dryer for the little knob that holds the cord up out of the way of countertop clutter.  And the bonus of the Night Lite ,I overlooked in the description online,  is great for nite trips to the potty. Nite lite can be shutoff if needed.  It sits nice and tidy in the room, up and out of the way of countertop. Wall Mounted Hair Dryer
__label__5 This is a really nice hair dryer.  Handle folds as advertised and cord retract works.  Fits nicely into a travel bag.  Price performance is excellent and recommend as a good value worth the investment. Excellent value.  Item received as advertised.  Compact.  Efficient
__label__5 Everything I want in a hair dryer.  Used the same model in a hotel I stayed out and had to have one for myself and one for my daughter. Rating for Andis RC-2 tonic 1875W ceramic hair dryer
__label__3 Surprisingly it works more often than not, but the cups seem to come off the mirror/wall a lot and have to be restuck.<br />Update ; I had to take it down as it came down all too often :(. It didn't hold for any reason that I can fathom :( !!! Love the concept. Like the product. No more!!!
__label__4 Good hairdryer - does its job and is good for the price. Not the strongest or hottest dryer out their, but dries hair quickly and easily and has settings to control temp. Good hairdryer for the price
__label__5 This is a great hair dryer.  Unlike most non-commercial hair dryers, it gets hot enough to quickly dry my hair.  It's weight is typical for dryers this size.  The buttons on the handle are easily avoided once you use the dryer a couple of times.  I also like the color.  I would buy this brand again. Andis hair dryer
__label__5 We use this multiple times a day and it is very convenient having it on the wall. Liked the idea after seeing it in hotel rooms. Great product
__label__1 Awful sound and no power.  Returned it. One Star
__label__5 Loved Bueno
__label__5 have everything i want,  go ooo oo o o o o o o o o o o oo o o d i love it
__label__5 I don't blow dry my hair everyday, so it hasn't gotten a good solid workout like ones I've used in the past.  That being said, I do like this hairdryer.  It is easy to travel with and doesn't weigh a ton - can easily hold it with one hand without your wrist tiring, while the other hand is styling with a brush.  The retractable cord is still working although at times it takes several tries to get it to completely retract now.  Worked very well when I first received it. Only started having trouble with that part over the past several months.  The control is a single control where the heat setting and volume of air setting are the same (low air flow and cooler air, highest air flow with highest heat.) If you want separate air flow and heat settings, this isn't the dryer for you. still working after 2 years
__label__3 I like the looks of these and have purchased a number of them for the rentals I manage as they mount on the wall. Out of about six I've bought, I have had one that I purchased in May 2015 to quit working, although it's had very little use. But, I am replacing it with the same type. Like these for my rentals, but.. had one to quit on me although it's brand new
__label__4 I purchased this dryer for a trip to Italy & it worked perfectly.  It has a switch so I can use it in either the USA or when I travel abroad.  Please note the directions read to only use on low setting when overseas; but the air volumne was still very good & I have thick hair!  You will need an adaptor for it for international travel, but not a convertor.  Overall very good product, lightweight and durable. Worked Great in Italy
__label__5 I wasn't expecting too much from the price but I definitely got my money's worth. I had an old dryer and this was much lighter and more quiet. It also has dried my hair faster, even on the low heat setting. Love the rubberized exterior which makes handling easier. Great purchase and would recommend it to a friend. Love the rubberized exterior which makes handling easier
__label__5 I got this hair dryer b/c I wanted a no-frills, sturdy hairdryer, and that's exactly what I got. It performs exceptionally well and I have even dried - wait for it - CHICKENS w/ it outside. It's that sturdy. :) B/c I'm a woman I'm not using the little blue button; regardless, this is an awesome piece of equipment. Weird name, great performance
__label__5 This blow dryer is lightweight and powerful.  I have thick Keratin relaxed hair and it tames my hair beautifully.  It gets very hot - which I need - and the airflow is strong.  There is a cool shot that helps with sealing in a curl or wave.  I would definitely recommend this product. Great blowdryer
__label__1 this product does not work well ensendido the button came broken and I can not turn off<br /><br />este producto no trabaja bien el boton de ensendido vino roto y no lo puedo apagar producto defectuoso
__label__5 My daughter uses it regularly. It does a good job drying and is easy to use. She actually sets up her art table and works while drying her hair! overhead dryer
__label__3 Gets my hair dry. Folds up neatly. But it didn't do anything extra special to my hair. It's a hair dryer...and it dried my hair. It gets the job done n fits in my luggage. So it does what it's supposed to do. Gets my hair dry. Folds up neatly. But ...
__label__4 I have to say this hair dryer is a really good product. It arrived when expected. I was very pleased that it contained a template so I would know exactly where to drill the pilot holes for the screws. I admit I had not seen that type of drywall anchor before and had to be extra careful not to knock them to far into the wall, but they worked just fine. My husband and I have been using the dryer for a couple weeks now. Just as other people mentioned, the nightlight is over the top, but I just use the GFI buttons on the plug to shut it it off. I love not having a hair dryer sitting on the counter. The only reason I removed one star is I wish the dryer had lower speed. It does have two speeds, but both are quite powerful. I would not hesitate to order again and probably will for the guest bathroom. Andis 30125 Wall Mounted Hang Up 1600 Watt Hair Dryer with Night Light
__label__3 If you are a master at wielding a blow dryer, you'll probably love this.  I find it too heavy and big for my hands when I am using the blow dryer to straighten my hair.  With that said, the various heat settings work well.  The concenrator attachments work fine for me.  I purchased this model in part for the comb attachment, but I can't manage the dryer properly with it attached.<br /><br />Update:  When I am not using the dryer to straighten my super curly hair, I like it.  My current hairstyle requires an hour under a bonnet dryer.  I can dry my hair in half the time using this hand-held dryer. Not for Amateurs
__label__5 Let's face it, I'm a guy.  I use a hair dryer about 3 minutes every morning when I get out of the shower.  I don't need tourmaline gemstone coated heating elements, I don't need salon-duty roller bearings, I don't need a pink gemstone-encrusted handle.<br /><br />I need something that blows hot air out the front when you press the switch, and this model does it.  Works fine, without all the bells, whistles, and gee-gaws, and without breaking the bank.  Oh and it's blue.  A good guy color. It's a Hair Dryer.  It Works.  What More Could a Guy Want?
__label__4 I selected this modeal as I had a previous model of this same hair dryer that finally failed after a few years of good service.  I purchsed the model 134R and it fit on the previous model's base plate, so I did not have to re-mount to the wall.  The light is now a LED version, which saves power but but puts out much less light than the older model- so it is not really suitable as a night light for the bathroom as the older model was (otherwise I would have given 5 stars).  The dual dryer settings are useful and the high setting is quite powerful- plenty for ay hair type in my opinoin. It is a noisy unit and can get quite warm, but performs as I expected. Overall, a good value for the money. Good Value
__label__5 Taking into account that this is a travel hair dryer, I have no complaints. It's been used for 5 to 10 minutes every other day for the past couple months and so far not a problem at all. There is only one tiny design complaint I have, and that is I figured the retractable cord would be completely hidden when fully retracted but theres a stopper which allows a good 10 inches of chord to remain...I wouldve preferred it to retract completely to the plug, but fine. I expected something different and this is what I got, so four and a half stars. Otherwise, so far a great product for the unbeatable price. For its size it dries fairly quickly, and does indeed fold up into a nice little package (however you'll end up winding the rest of the chord around it anyway). And the folding handle makes a fair amount of cracking noise when you fold it...not the smoothest mechanism, but fine. Once again, not perfect, but for size it's as good as it gets.<br />UPDATE: It's now been a good 12 months or so, and the usage has gone up to 5-10 minutes almost every day. It's fallen off the counter 3 to 4 times, and still works like a charm. The other day (now about 6 months ago) however, the button to retract the cord flew off (with spring) while the cord was furiously being pulled out. I tried to reattach but it lost its retracting mechanism. Fine, now it's a regular drier. Although I do have to admit it's definitely very powerful for its size, quite amazing actually. Still works like a charm. Does the job, for it's size...[updated]
__label__5 We purchased this unit after seeing it previewed on a shopping channel and hearing how professional stylists in Hollywood and elsewhere use it with great effectivness. Our experience is the same. On the low heat setting the temperature is consistent and the unit is much quieter than any other brand we've tried before. It has a nice long cord and comes with a supply of air filters. I have been able to eliminate hairspray as I style the hair with the dryer and a comb. There must be something special in the tourmaline technology and ions because my hair looks great. I recommend this product to anyone looking for a new hair dryer. It costs more than most dryers but the product quality, the quietness on the low setting, the long cord, the most important item, the way my hair looks makes the price worth it. Effective Quiet Dryer
__label__5 Hair gets dry fast! I have long hair, below my shoulders but above waist.  It takes me 35-40 minutes (I have fine textured hair).  The temperature never feels too hot but it does the job, even at its highest level; and there is barely any sound coming out of this hair dryer!  One can literally talk on the phone or what TV while under this dryer.  One of the pieces, the hinged hood, broke during shipping, but the company responded quickly and promised to ship it.  But I did not wait, I used super glue so that i could go ahead and start using it.  It works just fine! Wow!
__label__5 We were looking for a good quality, simple hair drier. This one seemed to fit the bill.<br />It works well, dries hair quickly, and seems to help tame the &#34;Frizzies.&#34; We have been using it for quite a while now, and have had absolutely no issues with it. Solid construction, and powerful
__label__1 Meh, it just doesn't work that well for me.  I think the diffuser needs to be smaller and curved more to better fit the shape of a person's head.  Somehow my wavy curls end up being too smooshed flat against my head, then sticking out toward the ends.  Not a fan, wish i hadn't tossed the box. disappointing for my waves
__label__5 Works great. Compact, portable, powerful. So far so good. Would purchase again. Purchased to replace an older model of same brand. great little hair dryer
__label__5 I do not buy anithing without try it first. But this blower its really great. its fast and powerfull, and reduce the time of drying in half. I love this product. Its really the fastest
__label__5 I am so happy with this purchase!! It works absolutely great.  I have very thick hair with natural curls.  Normally it takes me about 20 to 30 minutes to blow dry my hair and then I have to go over it with the flat iron to get it completely straight.  It took me ten minutes tops when using this blow dryer and it was perfect when I was done.  Not only was it straight but I was able to style it as well.  I have to say I'm shocked!!! and happy!! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who blow dries there hair straight. Awesome Awesome Awesome
__label__5 Was looking for something exactly like this! I have thick, medium length hair and this is perfect to completely dry damp, towel-dried hair. creates less frizz than a standard hair blow dryer and I believe it is faster to dry your hair with this. I originally bought two different Japanese model hair dryers and returned the lower wattage one to keep this one! Just the right strength. It does get hot so keep a continuous, slow pace as you move this throughout your hair and you'll be just fine. highly recommend! Powerful and Effective!
__label__4 Product works fine and installs easily - but you should make sure that you have an outlet and a place to mount the dryer that allows the cord to reach the outlet and the dryer to reach your head. With the cord from the dryer only about six feet when fully extended, finding that perfect spot is not necessarily as simple as you might think. Check the distance to your outlet
__label__5 I bought this razor for my Dad who decided to switch to electric shaving at age 97!  It works really great for him: shaves beautifully and is well designed.  You will not be disappointed with this shaver. good shave
__label__5 I love this hair dryer.  It dries my hair fast, and makes my hair very shiny and straight.  I used to use Revlon hair drier from drug store which is about $15.  Revlon hair dryer usually stops working after one year from purchase and makes my hair very dry and unhealthy.  This Panasonic hair dryer is a little pricy compared to regular dryer you can get from drug store but you get what you pay for.  It's worth it.  The finish of the body prevents your fingerprints to stick even though you have hair cream or hand cream on your hand so you can keep the beautiful appearance of the dryer. I feel my hair has been healthier and shinier with this.  I highly recommend this product. Best hair dryer ever!
__label__5 Bought two for guest bathroom and so far it's been perfect. Lots of power in a little size Lots of power for little size
__label__5 It is very handy, does a good job drying my hair. I liked it so well I bought a second one for the other bathroom. wall-mounted hair dryer
__label__5 Dries quickly without &#34;drying out&#34; my hair. Easy to handle and not heavy. Easy to handle and not heavy
__label__3 Good Hair Dryer.  Nice weight, cord good length.  I just had to get used to the button location, it took a while for me to be able to dry my hair without accidentally hitting the off button accidentally. Good Hair Dryer
__label__5 Works great. Good price. Just as described Hair Dryer
__label__3 Heavy, my expectation was much too high. The $ cost was high too. Three Stars
__label__5 I was really affraid to purchase this product on line, since its just coming out as one of Pibbs newest editions. I must admit,this blow dyer is hands down top of the line,I work mainly with blowouts on natural hair clients,Im saying this blow dryer can straighten out the thickest kinky tightly coiled hair hands down, during the blow drying process the hair is left super shinny and super manageable, oh and not to mention the drying time, I'm throwing the in towel on that one,just made my job easier, super light weight, not heavy like the other dryers use to be, my dryer for ever,love,love,love my new pibbs,faster drying time+more clients= fast money;) Top of the line product!
__label__5 This is a great unit to organize the bathroom. I'm not a fan of stowing the hair dryer away in a cabinet or drawer and taking it out for every use and I'm not a fan of having it sit on the counter all of the time. This is a great compromise. The unit is always ready to use and it doesn't take up space. Also, I am not able to mount this in studs, so I was concerned that the constant off and on might loosen this unit on the wall. There's no problem with that. I even bought an extra one for my kids' bathroom--and you know how kids can be rough. Both units are fine and show no sign of loosening. Lastly, it's easy to install. Love that part. I highly recommend this product. Perfect for the Bathroom
__label__2 I bought it for my wife - but she tells me that it is no good. The heat is not strong enough and when used for longer than 2 mins it will just turn off, until it cools off. Poor
__label__3 I'm a little disappointed, Andis.<br /><br />I bought this dryer for trips, and it does what it needs to do - it folds up, it dries my hair. But it's rather loud, and the cord isn't entirely retractable, and it's frankly a little underpowered - it's slow. Is it fine for trips? Yes. But I've used much better, stronger dryers that cost far less. Be aware: You're paying for the label, not the performance. (&#34;Ceramic&#34; - oh lord, that is truly up there with &#34;ionic&#34; in the pantheon of absurd &#34;just paint it on there and add another zero to the price&#34; labels!) I don't hate it, but I wouldn't buy it again. Not impressed
__label__1 The heating element in this hair dryer stopped working after three uses. I am in a protracted effort to get a replacement, although from reading other reviews it does not appear that the replacement will be any better than the original. Do not buy this hair dryer! It is unreliable. Heating element dies
__label__5 A long time Elchim user here- didn't think anything was better than the hot heat and forceful blow. Well- this is better than that! Fastest drying time ever, heat is right on. It is a little heavy, which frankly- none of the GOOD dryers are light, so you can't really ding it on that. I have hair to below my shoulder blades, wavy/frizzy, colored- and this makes it ALMOST to the point of no flat iron. Worth the price, just the best dryer ever! amazing!
__label__3 The dryer is heavier than expected, and for the wattage, it puts out less air than it should. Conair 225
__label__1 I was looking for something inexpensive for our vacation home so we could put in all the bathrooms.  Bought 3 of these and very happy, works better than the more expensive ones.  Have not had any problems thus far and works great.<br /><br />Edit:  Dropped this to one star.  In a year 2 out of the 3 I have bought failed.  One sounds like a bearing failing and the other won't get hot anymore.  Basically they are cheap for a reason.  One that failed, even thought a year old, was only used maybe 10 times. Was great now two have failed in a year
__label__5 I have three teenage daughters so recently I purchased three different hair dryers from Amazon. Imagine my surprise when I realized two were essentially identical except for the price, the length of the cord and the brand name. The Pro Beauty Tools 5885 Professional Lightweight Hair Dryer is the exact same as the Revlon RV544 1875 Watt Tourmaline Ionic Lightweight Dryer, Silver/Black by Revlon. Both of these hair dryers are made by Helen of Troy. Both have the same handle, body, and heat/speed options.  Both have the exact same Intertek number (3175842). The major difference is the Pro Beauty Tools hair dryer does have a cord that is 2' longer than the Revlon dryer and it (the Pro Beauty Tools) has an extra filter included. For the $10 difference in price (Pro Beauty Tools higher) one can decide if these options are worth the extra cash. In my opinion both of these items are a FIVE STAR item for price and performance. Exact Same Item as.....
__label__5 LOVE LOVE LOVE! this is the best hair dryer I've ever seen. It's really light, very quiet, and dispenses a small burst of cool air from above the nuzzle, which is unexpectedly brilliant. It also folds so it doesn't take too much space in my luggage when I travel. The chord is a bit too short, but with an extension is fine. LOVE LOVE LOVE
__label__5 This is a GREAT dryer and my review will compare the Sedu Revolution 4000i with the Harry Josh Pro Dryer 2000.<br /><br />When the Harry Josh 2000 dryer came out I was dying to buy it but just couldn't justify the price. I was in desperate need of a good dryer (since I straighten my hair almost every day).  After lots of research and reading reviews on every single dryer out there, I decided to go with the Sedu Revolution TGR 4000i. Especially since it was chosen by Harry Josh himself as HIS FAVORITE DRYER (obviously before he developed his own dryer)…so I figured the Sedu was a great choice. I've loved this dryer since day 1. Love it. But…I still had my heart set on the Harry Josh dryer. I figured it would be even better than the Sedu and somehow cut my dry time to mere seconds :)<br />I finally justified the purchase of the Harry Josh by telling myself that my Sedu would be my travel / back up dryer. After all, everyone needs an emergency blow dryer!<br /><br />So the Harry Josh dryer arrives and I immediately notice it's the same exact body casing as the Sedu. Even the attachments are exact and fit on both dryers. EVERYTHING and I mean everything right down to the cord length, switches, markings and body size were exact. Even the motor sounds exactly the same when turned on. The only difference I can see is that one is mint green and one is black.<br />Now I admit, I don't know what kind of motor each one has, but it seemed strange to me that Harry's new $250-300 dryer appears to be the exact same machine as his once beloved &#34;favorite dryer.&#34; So I decided to perform my own dry test and see which one, if any, dried my hair faster and made it smoother.<br /><br />I tested for six total days. For three days I dried with the Sedu and for three days with the Harry Josh. I alternated days to account for weather, humidity in the air, more or less product applied, etc.<br /><br />On all six days I followed the same exact routine (water temp / shampoo / conditioner / other hair product)<br /><br />Here's what I found:<br /><br />The Sedu Revolution dried my hair approximately one to two minutes faster than the Harry Josh on all days. On average, using the Sedu, it took about 5:30 min to get my hair dry and approx 7 minutes to dry it with the Harry Josh.<br /><br />The Harry Josh DID make my hair a slightly smoother, but nothing really earth shattering.<br /><br />I decided to keep my Sedu and return the Harry Josh.<br /><br />Note: My hair is slightly longer than shoulder length, curly, fine, and a little frizzy. It's also color treated.<br /><br />So all in all, I highly recommend the Sedu Revolution TGR 4000i dryer. Even though it's expensive it's totally worth it if you straighten your hair a lot. I'm thrilled with mine.r / other hair product)<br /><br />Here's what I found:<br /><br />The Sedu Revolution dried my hair approximately one to two minutes faster than the Harry Josh on all days.

__label__1 This is the worst hair dryer I have ever owned!! I ordered it shortly before taking a trip to Europe, trusting that it would work, happy about the fact that it was small and compact. I wasn't able to use it at all because it was so HOT I couldn't use it; and secondly it was burning my hair!! It was a waste of money and I highly discourage anyone else who might be interested in this product. Overheated hairdryer that burns hair!
__label__2 I read all of the reviews and decided to go ahead and buy this hairdryer in July 2013. It is a good, quiet hairdryer that I enjoyed for 16 months. However, just like the other reviews suggested, there is, indeed, a problem with this product as it has started to &#34;spit&#34; sparks as I'm drying my hair which is clearly dangerous. Although 16 months have passed I find it hard to believe the manufacturer wants a dangerous product out in the marketplace. According to the return policy, I am not able to get a refund or a new product so BUYER BEWARE! This product can be dangerous and their policy doesn't seem to address this situation. Amazon, please consider what you might do to help this situation given the product is spitting sparks within inches of your customers' faces. Perhaps you should discontinue selling it... BUYER BEWARE
__label__5 I hate most blow dryers.  They're either not hot enough or too expensive or they feel like they are blowing a soft spring breeze through my hair.  This one is perfect.  I have naturally wavy hair and blow it straight almost every day.  Either I'm loosing my mind or else this blow dryer really does make my hair feel softer.  Dries fast, too. Highly recommend. I've tried them all.  Buy this one!
__label__1 This hairdryer was a fine replacement (while it lasted) for my wife's old (used for 8+years!) Conair dryer that she loved.  She figured sticking with Conair would be a safe bet, given how long her mini travel dryer had lasted.  WRONG.  She had this one less than a year before the plug box started repeatedly shorting out whenever it was plugged in.  (We've never had any problems with other appliances plugged into the same outlet, including other hairdryers).  Ultimately, the plug box started smoking from the repeated shorts whenever the prongs touched outlet.  She just had to toss it and will have to buy another one far sooner than she expected she'd have to.  Conair should make better quality products than this! Was fine while it lasted...which wasn't long
__label__3 I know this was voted Best Hairdryer!!! by like 5 beauty magazines, and it does seem to dry hair pretty efficiently, but this review applies to guys with short hair that need to use a hair dryer to SHAPE their hair into styles (such as mohawks or fauxhawks). This is USEFUL for you stylish gents who are not just looking for a device to merely dry hair.<br /><br />I find that the high setting air current is not strong enough to really get your hair into staying straight upwards (if you're going for a mohawk or even a pompadour) and keep it there (the way some of the stronger hairdryers can). Especially if you have a thicker hair structure (wavy, curly), or your hair falls naturally in a certain way but you want it to be styled in an opposite direction. Using more hair product helps a little, but a stronger air current will work better (even though it is more damaging for your hair & scalp, so USE CAREFULLY AND WISELY)<br /><br />I figured there are enough men out there looking for just this function, so I figured I'd help you all out. Not as strong as I would like, and a bit overhyped by magazines
__label__4 Pros: quiet, small and portable, cute, works well.    Cons: needs a setting that blows just air and not heat. good little hairdryer
__label__5 This is a replacement for the same model hair dryer.  The first one lasted over 6 yrs.  I like the convenience of having it mounted on the wall rather than taking space on the counter.  I could not find one in the local stores and found the best price on Amazon.com Jerdon Wall Mount Hair Dryer
__label__1 I purchased this and received it two days later! As always Amazon.com shipping is superior! Ive never had issues with an items sold from amazon.com although I have with their third party sellers. I thought this was a safe bet. I attempted to use it for the first time today and it caught on fire!!! I was using it in a bedroom in a safe outlet that I use for chargers and other items with no issue! It was not around any water! My hair was dry and was using it to help make it straighter. At first it had a smokey smell and I thought maybe this is like a new hair dryer smell. My straightener sometimes smells like this if I use with my hair wet so I thought this was fine. I turned it out waited 5 mins then tried again and luckily I cautiously turned the hair dryer away from hair to make sure it was safe and sure enough fire came out I turned it off unplugged it and it patted it down with a blanket till I stopped. I was sooo scared! luckily I wasn't burned but my blanket had to be tossed! Amazon.com was helpful with processing a return and I still think revlon products are great but something must have been wrong with this particular one so be careful with this! Dangerous!
__label__2 I have had many other twin turbo dryers. I feel this one was not even close to the same as the drying power, and it is too small , and doesnt fit right in my hand.The heat is no where near as hot as it used to be. The only reason that I didnt return it was because of my own laziness. I will keep it as a second dryer, i will continue to search for something as good as the old twin turbo. Not Quite Happy
__label__5 This is a great hairdryer. It's light, and dries my hair fast. I was worried about frizzy hair, but the dryer doesn't make my hair frizzy. Great Hairdryer
__label__5 This is truly the BEST blow dryer for naturally curly headed gals!!! Powerful yet gently on my curls and easy to use.  LOVE this product:) This is truly the BEST blow dryer for naturally curly headed gals
__label__4 Looks sharp hanging up.  Small and compact and has good blowing action.  Only fault is that it only has two speeds and the heat setting is governed by the blower speed, but that is minor.  Would be nice to have a cool shot too.  The cord hangup tab is a good idea to keep the cord out of the way.  The dryer fits into the receiver fine, but it seems that it could be anchored into the holder a little better as it feels like it might fall out if bumped.  It hasn't yet, so it might just be my imagination. Andis Hangup Dryer
__label__5 It's amazing you don't know how bad your old hair dryer was until you purchase a new one! This hairdryer has so much power but is also quieter than others.  My old hair dryer took 20 min to blow dry my thin, fine hair. This one only took 5 min! Love the neon green color and love how the handle folds for travel.  Works great! Full of power
__label__5 My wife and I needed a new hair dryer, and we had good luck with Conair in the past, so I thought I would try this new model which was just introduced.  Works really great, and much much quieter than the old one, too.  Absolutely would recommend it!  5 Stars. and we had good luck with Conair in the past
__label__1 Cons: Low speed is too low, high speed is too high.  It doesn't blow hot air for the first 5 minutes.  Speed button is hard to control quickly, I always go past the off when I want it to switch off.  It reminds me of cheap hotel blow dryers.  The back doesn't have a filter, so my hair gets stuck in it if I turn wrong.<br /><br />Pros: It was cheap.  It's lightweight.<br /><br />Just pay $3 more for the better model. Not Worth the $$$
__label__5 I researched various black on-wall hairdryers and I liked that this one was compact and a cord that seemed like it would stay out of the way. I mostly purchased this for when the girls are at the house and need a hairdryer, but it's actually come in handy for me as well. Anyway, mount and forget this thing. The cord for how I mounted it does slop around on the counter top a bit, but you really need that to have a comfortable amount of distance to use it.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm very into more modern looking gadgets and the compactness of this and sleek black made it a great fit. After two-years, it's still working great and gets a decent amount of use. No problems whatsoever. Really good deal, working great after two-years
__label__3 If you're looking for a travel blow dryer that only blows &#34;luke warm&#34; air, then this is the one to get. But if you want it blow hot air like other blow dryers do, this one won't do it for you. Hot?! Not...
__label__2 The diffuser is very small and the hair blows all over . The dryer itself works fine I am a hairdresser and usually don't see a travel size diffuser except for the socks which I do not like so I was disappointed when this did not work well at all too much airflow through the diffuser. Disappointed in the diffuser
__label__5 But my first one was $300! I was thrilled to find one at this low price, and it has additional features! I love it because it works faster yet quieter than other blow-driers, is supposedly healthier for hair (mine is definitely less dry since using it!), and doesn't blow my hair all over at the high setting - it is very pleasant to use. Also my first one was a featherweight and I didn't notice that this one was not until it was already shipping. I decided to see if it was heavier, and it is not. So I am completely satisfied! I bring this with me to nice hotels because it's always better than whatever they provide. I had one before so already knew I'd love it
__label__5 This dryer is easy to hold and has alot of power and force.  I have thick hair and it dries my hair very quickly.  A great buy! Great and powerful little hairdryer!
__label__5 I read about the John Frieda Full Volume Hair Dryer in a magazine, and it has more than lived up to its review.  Dries quickly, leaves hair soft, WITH NO FRIZZIES, and with lots of body.  It's made my wavy, mind-of-its-own hair behave for the first time.  I highly recommend this product.  Couldn't live without it. Great Product!
__label__5 A solid hairdryer.  Not high-end, but perfect for the price. Perfect for the price
__label__5 Wife wanted good hair dryer.  I know nothing about them.  I poked around on the internet and read lots of reviews.  People were very positive about this brand and version.  It is a professional grade high quality dryer and she loves it.  She was not familiar with the brand previously.  The only thing to consider (and not a big deal) is that the power cord is longer than a typical home cord as it seems to true that this is used by professionals.  Not a big deal, but so you know it does not have a little curled up cord. This hair dryer is the boss
__label__2 I order this after reading all the reviews. Before purchasing this blow dryer I had a very cheap bottom of the line dryer from walmart. I will have to say I am disappointed with how long it still takes to dry my hair. I was expecting more since for me this was an upgrade. It feels & looks cheap also. ok
__label__4 The number of heat and airflow settings are exactly what I need.  The purple color is beautiful.<br />It uses toggle switch (instead of sliding switch) control and is very easy to change modes.  Airflow is adequate in high setting.  I expect this to last 2 - 3 years (based on my experience with Conair hair dryers). Working Well
__label__5 This is my second vidal sassoon dryer.<br />I bought a second one for travel.<br />I like the fact that it has 3 heat and 2 speed settings.<br />I may just get another for future use. Love this dryer.
__label__1 This worked great, while it worked. I only had it four months before it stopped working. The two speeds became one which was slower than the low setting. Of course, I was past the date to return or exchange, so I am back to buying a new one. Not worth it, unless you  only need a hairdryer for 4 months. Stopped working after 4 months
__label__4 Just got this delivered today, fast service. Put it together, but the directions and picture show a power on/off switch, mine doesn't have one, and instead of Fahrenheit it is Celsius. The dryer goes on when you set the timer. The picture on the box also shows a on/off button. Other than turning it on, I haven't used it. Tomorrow I will try it out. Did I get the right one?
__label__5 My mom is a cosmetologist & has always supplied me with professional grade dryers for my thick, heavy hair. This one works better than any other professional dryer I have tried. The cost was more reasonable too. This one works better than any other professional dryer I have tried
__label__5 I love tsi-la. Their scents are great and all natural without making you smell like an incense shop. I've tried other natural scents that are overpowering or as my non-crunchy sister would say it smells ethnic in here when I walk into a room. Moving on, all the tsi-la scents I've tried are great. I dont use perfume every day, but I keep this little rollerball in my purse cosmetic bag in case I go to an afterwork event or to freshen up if I'm on the go all day before meeting someone out. I'm no scent expert, but to me Fiori d'Arancio smells like *delicate fruit loops* Ok that sounds totally wacky but its a sweet, clean fruity smell, and smells natural--you can tell there arent chemicals in the scent unlike gross body splashes and stuff. its really hard to find a way to smell these before purchasing too, (occasionally you can find sample vials on an auction or deal site) and they are expensive, so the mini is a great way to test it out in an affordable way before upgrading to a full size. If the fruit loop smell is not for you, pass it on to a teenage girl you love. Personally I love it! Sometimes I mix it with my lavanilla rollerball for a delicious fruity vanilla scent! If you are concerned that perfume has toxic, hormone distrupting stuff in it, you owe it to yourself to try Tsi-La! Love it, Purse size, Pricey & Worth It. Smells like Fruit Loops.
__label__4 This product is of good quality.  It's lightweight, the cord is long, it's a little quieter than my previous hair dryer.  The only thing I didn't like is that when I use the hottest setting,it's not as hot as I would like it. hot tools hair dryer review
__label__5 I suffer from carpal tunnell syndrome.  I have had surgery but still have no strength for long periods of time.  Holding my hair dryer was really hard to do over a minute or two.  This product saved the day.  It is sturdy and accomodates my blowdryer really well even though it is a big one.  I would most certainly recomend this product to anyone. This is an awesome product
__label__5 I was looking for a wall mount dryer similar to my sunbeam that I have had for years. This one was similar in size and has a few more features.  The cord storage is wonderful as is the extra wattage. The handle is more comfortable than my old one also. Would definitely buy again. Did not dissappoint!
__label__5 the hair dryer works very well to dry hair fast without harsh heat. you can see the difference in stying compared to a traditional hair dryer. great product
__label__4 This hair dryer is as good as all the reviews say it is. It does give off a gross plastic smell when you use it though. If you can get past that then you'll love it. I love it even with the odor
__label__5 I would defiantly recommend this hair dryer!! It's lightweight, quiet and drys my hair fast without leaving it frizzy! I was hesitant to buy because it was a little on the expensive side but I'm glad I made the purchase. Great styling tool!
__label__5 I have owned one of these for over 5 years and couldn't be more satisfied.  I originally paid $40.00 and thought that was a high price, but after years of faultless performance, I'd pay that price again.  I'm glad I don't have to because now the price has really come down.  This small hairdryer has more air force than all the big clunky ones I've used in the past.  The telephone type cord is rugged and will stretch as far as 10 feet.    Excellant product in every category. Excellant Product!
__label__3 The genuine boars bristle brush is too soft and will not turn or lift my hair. The bristles just squish out and do not stay stiff enough to work hair. I think the boars bristles would be even worse with thick hair. They need a stiff nylon brush option.  They also need a medium speed for drying. You get slow low and fast high and if you can hold your finger on the quick heat button then maybe you can get to medium heat and blowing speed from the low setting but you can't hold the button for long. There should be some sort of trigger with the quick heat button built in or a way to lock it down. I don't use the other two attachments. I'd swap them for two different brushes or one good stiff brush attachment. Needs Stiffer Brush
__label__5 I had my previous Vidal Sassoon hair dryer for a VERY long time.  My own stupidity was actually its undoing. I tried to clean off the grate inside by opening the unit and ended up not putting it back together quite right, burning out the motor. Soooo I had to get another hair dryer.  I decided on this one for the price and ratings for the most part. It is heavier probably because of the ceramic inside. I only use it to quickly dry my short hair after a shower so it works great for that. I probably got more than I need in a hair dryer but it does work for me and it works swell. It is the bees knees! Don't know what that means exactly and I am younger than that saying is....but it is kinda fun saying it anyway. It works SWELL
__label__5 It arrived quickly, was a beautiful red, light as a feather and, on high, dries hair super-quickly.  Also, it's much quieter than my previous one with all the added power. Light-Weight Power House
__label__3 I thought the button issue that everyone else wrote about would escape me. Nope. Almost every time I dry my hair I hit the temp or speed button... at least 2-3 times. It's does a great job drying but the buttons cause just enough nuance that I would recommend to keep looking. I like it but can't wait for it to break and find a new hair dryer. Oh the Buttons. THE BUTTONS!
__label__5 I've had this hairdryer now for about 3 - 4 weeks.  Just love the low heat setting - temperature remains comfortably low even when increasing the speed to high.  It is fairly light and quieter than others I've had. Love this hairdryer
__label__1 I've had this dryer for only 8 months and the high speed setting no longer works. I would have rated this very highly had it continued to function properly, but for the cost of this dryer, lasting less than a year is completely unacceptable. Broke in less than a year
__label__5 Works well and I don't feel like I'm damaging my hearing when using it.  Shipped quickly.  Stores well and electrical cord recoil is cool. Quieter than my last hairdryer
__label__4 My new Conair 1875-Watt Pro Style Hair Dryer works just fine, but my previous one (same brand and same wattage) was much lighter to hold. I'm getting used to it but was hoping when I ordered it that it would be exactly like the one I had, since it lasted for years. A Little Heavy
__label__4 Good product.  Looks lilke its well made and easy to hankle.  Only knock is its a little heavy.  Otherwise well worth the money. Good Product Well Worth the Money
__label__3 Looked nice.  Didn't even turn it on as it was too large for my space to hang it.  Need to have dimensions in description. Too large for my area
__label__5 Small. cheap and works well for what it is. Don't expect the power from a full size dryer but this works great as a mini dryer for traveling. Great
__label__5 I highly recommend this dryer if you have thick or coarse hair that needs to be smoothed or straightened. If you are the type of person who just flips the hair around and smooths with fingers, this might be too much dryer for you, but I have no experience with that kind of hair. This is my first professional hair dryer, and I couldn't be happier. I have medium coarse hair (mixed race, ringlets, coarse but not kinky. 3b maybe?) that is currently just below chin length. I'm super-skeptical about product claims, so I did a lot of research. I read an article about a comparison of several models that convinced me of the effectiveness of titanium, and I knew I wanted 2000 watts just cause I wanted as much power as possible. There aren't too many dryers with those 2 features, so after reading the positive reviews, I decided on this model. From the first time I used it, I was very pleased. My hair was definitely softer and smoother. I never believed a hairdryer could make your hair softer, but this one definitely did. I can also dry my hair much more quickly, but I think that is because with this hair dryer, I am actually able to dry my hair like the hairdresser does (in big sections, using the curve of my head to smooth it out.) Previously, I always had to dry my hair in 1-2inch sections wrapping around and pulling with a round brush, which takes FOREVER. If I dry my hair that way with this dryer, it still takes about as long, but I don't really get much better results so I don't bother. CONS: 1. I still have to use a flat iron to smooth my ends. For the life of me, I can't get smooth ends with a hair dryer. I was really hoping this dryer would solve that for me, but instead it has convinced me that it is my technique, not the dryer. 2. It really does get HOT. I have to use medium heat around the edges of my hairline, and that can still be a little intense. If you have a sensitive scalp, this might be too much dryer for you. 3. The nozzles seem kinda cheap. My last hair dryer had  nozzles that snapped on, which made it easier to rotate and change the angle. These nozzles just fit snugly over the barrel and often come off when I try to rotate them. I can't speak to some of the other complaints about this dryer like weight and noise. I wouldn't call this dryer light or quiet, but it doesn't seem particularly loud or heavy to me. Personally, I wouldn't want to give up the performance of this dryer for those features.<br /><br />Hope this review helps, and happy styling everyone! Better than I had expected!
__label__5 If you are looking for a lightweight dryer that doesn't create hurricane force winds this is the one. My hair is short/medium length and fine. I don't need a mega dryer that sound like an aircraft. This is a compact little thing that fits the bill. It is also a tad quieter than the typical 1875 watt dryer. Two settings high(hot) and low (warm)work great for creating a curl/wave with a round brush. Would recommend for short to medium length fine hair. Compact dryer works well for fine hair
__label__5 In a good, no, a great way! It is a *little* heavier than some models, but I'm only using it for a max of 15 minutes a day so that doesn't bother me. And I only mention it here because many of the reviewers I read listed that as a con. As for how quiet it is, I would say it's as quiet as the other &#34;quiet&#34; dryers I've owned made by other companies. It's not a whisper, but it's not a scream. My hair looks better than it has in a long time... It's certainly shinier and looks thicker when I use this dryer. The dryer is also a very sexy looking piece, so if you're going buy based on looks, go for this machine! The only negative I have is the cold shot button. I foresee this button breaking easily and in the near future. I try to avoid using the shot button in favor of the cold setting switch to prolong the inevitable, though.  I truly do love this dryer. I was not compensated for my review. I bought the dryer after researching. I'm very happy with my purchase! This dryer blows...
__label__5 As a hairstylist I have used MANY drying tools and NOTHING compares to this dryer.  I will never use another the famous CHI including.  CHI doesn't come close to this one!!!! And the cost you just can't beat it.  I had ,my first twinturbo for about 10 years roughly, It hasn't completely quit on me yet but showing signs of getting tired so I'm buying another because I will NOT work without this dryer.  It will not disappoint....HINT  NOTHING manages frizz except products.  So don't think a dryer is going to eliminate frizz because that's nonsense. Best they make
__label__5 This is a very simple but great blower.  We are using it daily and are happy with it.  Good product. Great
__label__4 This is my second purchase of the Sunbeam/Oster wall mounted hair dryer.  After years of enjoying the wall mount in hotels, I decided to buy one for my bathroom at home.  Best thing I could have done.  When my first one gave out...had to have another.  Plus:  Convenient, easy to use, out of the way of other things, and clean.  Minus:  Lower wattage means slower drying.  Would not like it for long, thick hair.  Cord could stand to be longer to stetch just a bit further.  Really like this product! Ladi vs. Hairdryer
__label__5 A huge step up from the one it replaced.  Feels solid and works great. Very nice
__label__4 Great product!! Only thing is base gets really hot after 5 min. Four Stars
__label__4 My wife already has this dryer, but she wanted another one to gift someone. The good thing I like about it is the dual voltage switch, compact, very simple to use. Also it has the Cool switch that blows cold air that my wife likes as well. Overall simple to use and works good. The only con I can think of is the chord gets in the way a lot.    By the way, the old one we had is still good, except there is some rust on the rim now so try to keep it away from any moisture.... Already had one, needed another one!
__label__5 Having recently broken my wrist and also having hand function issues, this is the perfect dryer for me. I also loved the price and it is supposed to be a high quality dryer that should last for years. So what else could you want? I have never used more than high and never use those cool shots or ionic type dryers. This fits my needs perfectly. Love it! Very Light Weight and Yet Powerful
__label__4 Very light weight and worked fine for my hair which is mid length.  Easy to switch voltage which I did before going to Italy. I did use it on high and had no issues so did not experience what some others posted.  You will need just an adapter. Loved this little dryer for travelling
__label__5 Not only does this dry my hair faster than my older dryer, and it's light, it actually creates lasting body for my fine straight hair that I've never had, and leaves it shiny and looking like a million bucks. Best $130 I've spent in a long time, and cheaper than more frequent hair cuts, that's for sure. People think I got a new haircut!
__label__5 Love it. Have very long thick hair. Cut drying time almost in half. Did not frizz my hair as other dryers have in the past. I'd buy this product again :-)
__label__5 Exactly what I was looking for! Here's hoping it lives a long and service-oriented life. Five Stars
__label__5 Peroxyl isn't available where I live. The shipment was slower than I expected but arrived at the end of the promised time frame. The product is excellent for gum problems and was recommended by my dentist. It shouldn't be used without a dentist's approval. Peroxyl
__label__5 Excellent purchase. If your hairs are wet and messy, the dryer makes them quick and easy to manage. Five Stars
__label__5 I was finally ready to replace my 8-year old travel hairdryer  with something more powerful and quite, and yet just as light-weight. I have fine shoulder length hair with a tendency towards frizz.. I stumbled across the positive reviews for the Onei MKII while researching several other hairdryers (T3 featherweight, Elchim 2001 and BaBlyiss 2800). I chose the Onei based upon the great reviews, the 4-year warranty, and the price. I think this hairdryer is great. It is very quite, dries my hair in half the time, and feels like it will last. My hair feels great - not scorched like with my old dryer. If you are looking for a top-performing dryer, I would highly recommend trying this dryer first! The cool setting actually gets very cold, which is also  a great bonus for locking in curl and reducing frizz. Quiet and fast
__label__5 This is a great hair dryer. I love the retractable cord and the folding handle -- makes it great for travel. The 1875 watts of power dry the wet hair quickly and I don't have any frizz problems. Other hair dryers don't seem to put out as much hot air so I really like this one for the nice blast of heated air. I've not had any problems with the cord and it's lightweight and easy to maneuver.<br />Recommended! Great dryer and love the folding handle!
__label__4 I love the Yellowbird! I have very long hair and it holds up to drying my hair, as other dryers wind up overheating before my hair is dry. Not this one. It is powerful, unlike many other dryers, and I love the Cool setting that is continuous instead of being a cool shot.  I would reccomend this dryer for anyone with thick, long hair. Powerful dryer!
__label__5 This is the best hair dryer I have had so far.  It dries great and doesn't make weird noises or show sparks or do any of the weird scary thing some of my others have. Best hair dryer
__label__4 After reading the good to excellent reviews I purchased the dryer recently.  The delivery was speedy and all the parts were included.  My adult son, who's good at assembling things, put it together for me.  I'm African-American with long Locs that I roll-up on curlers and my hair dried evenly at a comfortable setting.  I had to place thick cushions on my folding chair, which is somewhat low,  to sit high enough for my head to be covered under the dryer.  I wasn't able to adjust the height locking knob to lower the hood.  I'll have to call on my son again.  I love the convenience of giving my hair a deep heat conditioning, rinsing, rolling it on rollers, then drying it with my own professional bonnet style hood dryer.  My curls were soft and springy.  I've only used it once and so far so good for the price, timer and range of heat settings, size of the hood, ease of use, and aesthetics. So far so good.
__label__5 Very good. We recommend it for multiples use for home and traveling when the the hotels do not have dryer. Rosa
__label__3 its okay but with only 2 heat control is not good Three Stars
__label__5 Used this at one of top brand name Hotel, Like it very much, air volume is good with reasonable noise. Excellent product. Like it very much
__label__5 I've only used this dryer a few times,as it is my travel dryer but I love it.  The ionic feature works even better than my regular ionic dryer in smoothing the hair. The three speeds are wonderful and very hard to find for a travel dryer.  It's a little bigger than most travel dryers but folds up nice and compactly.  Great product at a good price. Great hair dryer
__label__5 Great hair dryer. Been using it for a few months now and no complaints so far. Five Stars
__label__5 While US Pediatricians strongly urge parents to leave the earwax removal to professionals, people in Asia do this all the time. I was able to see the earwax with the light and gently scoop out the canal.  The big scoop and the tweezers were too big for his 9 year old ears but the smaller scoop worked perfectly.<br /><br />WARNING: DO NOT try this on yourself or go too deeply in the canal.  It's long enough to do some real damage. Works Like a Charm- But Don't Go Crazy
__label__2 Everything was great for about 6 month, the it stop working, why they keep selling a product that only last 6 months?, Better to take them from the market entirely and replace it with on that works longer even id it is more expensive.  One thing is certain, I will not buy a Remington drier ever!! Doesn't last
__label__5 I love this dryer.  It has improved the texture and whole condition of my hair.  My (African-American) hair is less frizzy, smoother and calmer.  I'm buying two more for my sisters as Christmas presents. Great Dryer!!
__label__4 I use this frequently and its working well so far.  A little bigger and louder than I expected but tolerable. Good so far
__label__5 I dry my hair almost every day as my hair is rather long. This little beauty does its job, and does it well. There are plenty of settings and options to choose from, depending on what you want and what is best for your hair. I have no complaints whatsoever.<br /><br />Update: It's been several months now, and I still use this product almost every day, and it still works great. This is easily the best hairdryer I've ever purchased - strong, fast, and definitely good quality! Fantastic hairdryer!
__label__5 I enjoy using this product.  Dries long hair very fast.  I have no problem recommending this product to a friend. Works Great
__label__5 I bought this because my boyfriend didn't have one and I'm not used to air drying my hair when I shower at his place. He also needed one to dry off his dogs after washing them. I did my research and this one had great reviews and was the cheapest. I thought the item would be bigger but to my surprise it was a portable size so that was even better! The low setting is too low for me and drying my hair on the high setting was perfect. It even has a removable cap on the back for you to clean. For the price I paid, it definitely does its job and dried my hair quick! I would highly recommend this product to anyone! Great price & does its job!
__label__4 great blowdryer for the price, has three settings, is definitley an improvement over my old dryer. Im not sure if this gets as hot as I would like, but for the price, I am very satisfied. great for the price
__label__5 Can not enough about. Thought it was all BS about the ionic, tourmaline and ceramic features really having that much of an effect. OMG it is so true. I only tried this blow dryer because I wasn't gonna spend good money on some features that probably are false. Even me going cheap worked. Do not waste your money on more powerful expensive brands. This will get the job done. You should never use above 1800W anyhow. Don't forget to use cool burst all over head after drying as well. MIRACLE worker.<br /><br />My hair usually takes 40 minutes plus With no brushing, which makes it take way longer.<br />My previous dryer had way more W and blew harder.<br />This dryer takes my hair 10-15 minutes (maybe) with brushing it out.<br />My hair is soft and semi sleek.<br /><br />My hair is extra coarse, dry, frizzy and THICK. This dryer made my hair wonderful. I was able to do things to my hair that I never have before because of it. So in love. I have coarse thick hair...but not when I dry
__label__5 Over all great product! It's stylish, light weight, easy to use and hold. Very strong and powerful air power for being such a small blow dryer. You have all the functions like hot and cool, high and low. The black handle has glitter in it and it sparkles in the light lol. All in all this is a great blow dryer and even better price! Wonderful
__label__1 Sending it back.  Blows too hard on high....needs another speed besides low. Sending it back. Blows too hard on high. ...
__label__4 This blow dryer is generally nice. The only thing that I do not like is that it does not have temp. and speed settings. It only has low temp./low speed, medium temp/medium speed, and high temp./high speed. You cannot change these corresponding temp./speed settings. Other than this I like the wide tooth comb attachment. I have natural hair and this helps me detangle and stretch all of my hair. It works pretty great, came on time. My mom is buying two for herself and my sister. I would recommend this. Recommend
__label__5 I have had a hair dryer for years when it gave out. I have always used Con Air products and have been very happy with them. This hair dryer does NOT disappoint.  Great product has several sets to choose from and a cool button which is really neat feature I never had that before. It has high power but not overwhelming for you or your hair. Love this product and love Conair! I have always used Con Air products and have been very happy with them
__label__4 Fits well in the RV, works but have not been on a trip yet to use it.  Amazon C/S was great to look up measurements for me to make sure it would fit in the space we had.  I had ordered 2. Previously and they would not fit.  Vendors need to put measurements of units in descriptions. For RV
__label__5 I bought 3 Sunbeam 1500 wall mount hairdryer back in 2000 and had used them since. After a few years' use I noticed the plastic part got a small hole burnt. I found a way to still use it by letting it sit until it cooled down before placing it back into the mounting fixture. So based on the durability of the product I bought this model again expecting Bunbeam to have improved in the design about the heat discipation. My previous 3 dryer are still working but I changed them all anyway.<br />I'm impressed with the new design - it becomes more stylish and after drying my hair when I hold the blow hole by hand it's just mildly warm - not hot at all. It is not a very quiet hairdryer but I'm happy with the purchase. I expect to last 20 years. Improved design - more stylish than the old model
__label__5 I bought this for my niece for Christmas. I have heard no complaints so far. Shipping was fast. So far, so good
__label__5 I feel so silly ordering toothpaste from the internet, but none of my local stores stock this gel bottle version anymore! Our local pharmacy usually has the Cinnamon Rush in a tube, which is okay, but I really prefer the texture of this gel. And the multi-pack price is really generous (at least compared to what toothpaste sells for individually at retail). new favorite toothpaste
__label__4 Purchased as a gift for my roommate. She likes it. It is quiet, not too heavy, & dries quickly. She stated that it was a bit large, but she was previously using a travel size as her everyday dryer. Purchased as a gift for my roommate. She likes ...
__label__4 It's a little bigger than I had imagined but the weight is okay and it works quick. I haven't noticed any change in my hair texture or look but it works well otherwise. And mine didn't come with a diffuser as some reviews mention. Quick dryer
__label__5 After my blow dreyer of 10 years stared to loose it's &#34;umff&#34; I turned to amazon of course so look through some reviews and came across this blow dreyer, my hair stylist, who is a trusted friend even recommended it, and of course even she couldn't beat the price, it works really well, my hair is much smoother after using this dreyer versus my old one, it was definitely time for an upgrade. The power is great and I didn't find it to be to heavy. I have long fine hair and it dried very quickly so that's nice considering I'm a mom with a 14 mo old who doesn't have to much primp time in the mornings :)  I would definitely recommend this dreyer! Great blow dreyer!
__label__4 I bought this hair dryer in January of 2010 and it's been just great.  However, let me warn you that if it starts to make a low metallic or grinding noise, stop using it!  I tried it once more after hearing that and the thing started vibrating wildly and made a terrible noise as if it were about to fly apart in my hand.  I unplugged it just in time.  Maybe you won't have this problem if yours doesn't see much travel. Mine was in and out of suitcases so that may have contributed. Love it, but a warning!
__label__1 The most awful hair dryer ever. Very Heavy and the hot almost burnt my hair. Make a light weight product Remington!!! The most awful hair dryer ever. Very Heavy and ...
__label__5 oh my I am so pleased. I had my other Vidal Sassoon hair dryer for 22 years. it went through me and 2 daughters and still works. I don't think it gets as hot as it used to, but never the less. This blower has large shoes to fill. if it last half as long I will be very pleased. love it
__label__5 has different settings for temperature and power. works great so far and comes with the extra parts (which i haven't yet used). great
__label__5 Dries hair quickly.  Excellent price.  I have 15 amp service, and it doesn't blow fuses.  It should blow a fuse on high (given the watt rating, but it doesn't). Go figure. Light weight
__label__5 I absolutely love this blow dryer and the attatchments, I usually buy CHI for my blow dryer but the last one shorted out within a year so I decided on trying Hot Tools and I was in love. Multiple settings so you can dry/style your hair just right and the attachments work great for stying my bangs and straighening with the blow dryer. I would definitely buy Hot Tools and recommend this blow dryer to anyone. Chi vs. Hot Tools
__label__4 I have very curly hair & am used to blow drying it straight (have been doing it for >10 years) and using a flat iron to get it frizz free.  This hairdryer is not as good as most of the reviews made it seem: the nozzle only covers a small area, and I still need to use a flat iron.      However, the hairdryer is powerful--it cut 5 minutes off my hair drying time (20 min down to 15).  Another plus is that it is quieter than most. Decent Hairdryer
__label__5 If you are like me, the cheap cotton rounds shred when using them leaving annoying pieces of cotton all over your hand and face.  I've always paid more for premium rounds less likely to shred and they are becoming harder to find in the stores in my area.  These don't shred and have the choice of an exfoliating side or soft side.  Search carefully at Amazon.com to find the lowest cost.  I got mine for $19.99 for a box of 8 tubes and free shipping when I added another free shipping product that I also wanted.  I'm happy to store these until I use them given the quality and price I paid. No shredding!
__label__5 The settings are wonderful and my hair did feel a lot softer after using! The heat setting are great too... I like the option of having cool, warm and hot... the dryer is super powerful and definitely cut down on drying time. And the retractable cord is great! I would definitely recommend this blow dryer to a friend! LOVE this blow dryer!
__label__5 I received my leopard Babyliss dryer from Beauty And, and I believe it is the real thing - not a counterfit. The packaging, accessories, and dryer all appear to be very well-made with great attention to detail. The cord is quite thick and long; you can tell by the cord alone that it is a powerful machine. It is the best hairdryer I have ever owned and it dried my very long fine blonde hair in under 5 minutes, without much heat at all (seems like it would cause less damage to hair). It is certainly worth the $59.95 I paid for it. Leopard Babyliss Portofino 6600 from Beauty And is a legit machine
__label__3 Except not drying at back of head well it is very satisfactory Three Stars
__label__5 I had first seen/used this hairdryer at a Hampton Inn and was impressed with how well it performed: quiet, powerful, and solid.  Not too heavy, with a grippy handle.  So...I bought one for myself and love it! Great Dryer for a Reasonable Price
__label__5 Dries really fast. I have to use a brush and brush my hair while using this dryer or else it is just an odd mess. I live in area with high humidity off the Gulf coast and my hair stays flat all day! Even straighter than my straight haired friends. I do have to use another dryer when I want to wear my curls because this dryer takes them out. Dries really fast. I have to use a brush ...
