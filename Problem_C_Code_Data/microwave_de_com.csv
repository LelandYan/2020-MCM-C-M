They did replace the handle, but they said they can't do anything about this display as its not covered.<br /><br />As for using the microwave, it is a pain.

I used to have double wall ovens and a Jenn Air cooktop with grill/griddle. We've downsized but this oven gives me most of the benefits that I had with that setup.<br /><br />The small oven is perfect for 95% of the needs for my wife and I, but I do expect the large oven will get a work-out at Thanksgiving when we have at least 7 for dinner. The Power Boil is terrific, and the grill/griddle is very handy and easy to clean.<br /><br />I debated quite a bit between this and the PGB950SEFSS. The main differences:<br /><br />* This model has a porcelain top surface, the 950 is stainless<br />* The 950 has a double-ring, 19,000 BTU boil burner - this has a single-ring 17,000 BTU<br />* The 950 has dual broiler burners, this has one broiler<br />* The 950 has a ball-bearing roller rack (I believe just one of the three) where this has all standard slide racks<br />* $700 MSRP price difference<br /><br />To be honest I prefer the porcelain top surface of this oven aesthetically, but that's definitely a matter of opinion. The other features just didn't add up to $700 for me. I did use the broiler for a small frittata and that worked fine, but I can see how the double broiler could provide more even heat on a larger dish. The Power Boil is excellent on this, I don't see 10% higher BTU making a tremendous difference.<br /><br />I also considered these other five-burner double-oven ranges: Frigidaire FGGF304DLF, KitchenAid HGRS505XSS, LG LDG3036ST, and Whirlpool WGG7550BS.

721617315,R1FEVPTESSYGBZ,52072264,721617315,5,0,N,True,0,DOES THE JOB,"DESCRIPTION<br />&#62; Can be mounted in a 24&#34; wide X 12&#34; deep space.  Not intended to be installed above a range (standard ranges are 30&#34; wide), does not include a built-in hood for use above a range.<br />&#62; Has the great simple operation of previous Spacemakers: for example to heat a cup of coffee 1 minute, place it in the microwave and press &#34;1&#34;.  That's all.<br />&#62; Well built, albeit with more plastic and less metal than my old Spacemaker II.<br />&#62; Quieter than my old Spacemaker II--although that's no big deal.<br />&#62; The turntable is a nice addition (my old Spacemaker II did not have a turntable), but reduces the total space available (unless you turn the turntable off).<br />&#62; Has all of the controls and options of my old Spacemaker II:<br />...Plus popcorn, &#34;beverage&#34;, &#34;reheat&#34;, &#34;chicken/fish&#34;, &#34;potato&#34;, and &#34;vegetable&#34; buttons (which I probably won't use because I like to know what the microwave is doing).<br />...Other new buttons are &#34;delay start&#34;, &#34;reminder&#34;, &#34;turntable on/off&#34;, and &#34;add 30 sec&#34;.  The &#34;add 30 sec&#34; works on its own, you can press it and get just 30 seconds OR add 30 seconds to any time.  30 seconds is ideal for warming a cup of coffee, or heating some pastries.<br />...There is a child lockout, but without a dedicated button.<br /><br />UNDERCOUNTER INSTALLATION<br />&#62; The microwave itself comes with a paper template for drilling the necessary holes, but the template can be confusing and may not apply in all cases.<br />&#62; The microwave hangs from four ~1 1/4&#34;-long machine screws, which are inserted from above, from inside the cabinet above.  If the floor of the cabinet is greater than 1/2&#34; thick, then the length of the screws needs to be equal to the thickness of the floor plus 1/2&#34;.<br />&#62; Hypothetically, you could install the microwave with the four screws from your local hardware store, and 4 big washers (e.g., 2&#34; in diameter).  However the installation kit is probably easier.<br />&#62; If you use the template, double check the logic, and adjust the location of the screw holes accordingly.<br />... The key measurement is the distance from the front holes to the front of the cabinet. You usually want the front of the microwave to be flush with the front of the closed doors of the cabinet.  (That is, the front holes should be approximately 3 1/4&#34; back from the front of the closed doors).<br />... The door of the microwave needs an extra 1/8&#34; on the left in order to open fully, and the grill for the ventilation fan is on the left side of the microwave.  If there is an obstruction on the left side (such as wall, cabinet, or refrigerator), you may wish to shift the holes 1/4&#34; to the right, if you can.<br /><br />UNDERCOUNTER INSTALLATION KIT<br />&#62; If this is an new undercounter installation, or the space between the front and back screw holes (inside the cabinet above the microwave) is not ~6 1/4&#34;, then you need GE part #WX4-A019 [[ASIN:B001H815TO GE Part Number WX4-A019 UNDER CAB MT]].  If you are replacing a Spacemaker with a distance of ~6 1/4&#34; between the front and back holes, then you probably do NOT need an installation kit.<br /><br />IF YOU ARE REPLACING AN OLD SPACEMAKER II (for which the spacing between the front and rear screw holes is ~7 3/4&#34;)...<br />&#62; I purchased this Profile Spacemaker to replace a 23-year old Spacemaker II.  But neither the holes, backing plate, nor the screws were the same.<br />&#62; The spacing from the cabinet front to the forward screw holes is almost the same for my old Spacemaker II and this new Profile Spacemaker.<br />&#62; The lateral spacing (side-to-side) between the screw holes is the same 19 15/32&#34; for my old Spacemaker II and this new Profile Spacemaker.<br />&#62; But the spacing between the front and rear holes is NOT the same (the new spacing is 6 1/4&#34;).<br />&#62;So, if the holes in your cabinet are for the old Spacemaker II, then you need only drill new rear holes in your cabinet for this Profile Spacemaker.  Draw a line on the cabinet between the centers of the existing front and back holes, measure 6 1/4&#34; back from the center of the front hole, and drill the new hole there.<br />&#62; The screws seem to be very similar, but a slightly different diameter or pitch (perhaps they are metric). Hypothetically, you could drill new holes in the old backing plate (or use washers instead of the backing plate), and find screws the right size and length, but I decided to purchase the new kit instead.<br /><br />BEFORE YOU REPLACE A DEAD MICROWAVE OVEN ...<br />&#62; My old Spacemaker II died three times over 23 years as the result of power surges (lightning).  I accidentally learned that the trick is to unplug the microwave overnight for the electronics to reset.  I've had the same experience with several other appliances.<br />&#62; Even refrigerators and clothes driers have built-in computers these days.  If any electric appliance is not working properly, unplug it, and leave it unplugged a while.  For some reason (perhaps large capacitors in the circuit) big appliances usually need hours to reset.<br /><br />RELIABILITY<br />If my experience with my old Spacemaker II is any indication, this Profile Spacemaker should be very reliable.  Although resurrected 3 times over 23 years, my old Spacemaker was still working when I &#34;took it out of service&#34;.  After 23 years of daily use, some of the white finish was turning yellow, there were patches of rust inside, and the door switch (which turns the light on and off) was erratic.<br /><br />IF YOUR OLD SPACEMAKER HAD A TRAY INSTEAD OF A TURNTABLE, keep the tray from your old microwave.<br />&#62; The tray will fit in your new Profile Spacemaker.  The tray will catch spills and protect the bottom of the microwave from abrasion and burnt-on spills (which may promote rust in the future).<br />&#62; I use the glass tray when I'm using a large rectangular casserole, or many small containers.  I often warm two 12&#34; diameter full plates of food---I use a small glass storage container as a spacer so that the plates can overlap.<br />&#62; If you use the tray, lift out the glass turntable and rollers and turn off the turntable drive, then place the glass tray in the bottom.<br /><br />GENERAL HINTS ON MICROWAVE COOKING<br />It is largely steam created by the microwaves which does the cooking, so the key to cooking many items (especially vegies) is to generate and hold that steam.<br />&#62; If you are warming bread, wrap it in a towel.  It is astounding how effective a single layer of paper towel can be.  If the bread is rock hard, slightly dampen the towel, and use half-power--the warm bread will be soft and fresh.  Heat only briefly and/or at reduced power.<br />&#62; You can even bake potatoes or roast ears of corn-on-the-cob in a microwave, if you wrap them in a damp cloth towel.<br />&#62; Rinse vegetables before you cook them---that washes off any pesticides etc., and the extra water will produce extra steam.  If the vegies are dehydrated after long storage, you may want to soak them a few hours ahead to time to re-hydrate them.<br />&#62; It is usually best NOT to boil vegies in a container of water in a microwave, because the excess formation of steam LOWERS the cooking temperature.  Your goal should be to create a little steam, contain it, and superheat it.  (This is the same principle as a pressure cooker).<br />&#62; Stir some oil (e.g., olive) oil with cut vegetables---a coating of oil will help hold the steam inside the individual pieces of vegetable.<br />&#62; A selection of glass casseroles of a range of sizes with glass lids can be essential for microwave cooking.

GENERAL HINTS ON MICROWAVE COOKING It is largely steam created by the microwaves which does the cooking, so the key to cooking many items (especially vegies) is to generate and hold that steam. &#62; If you are warming bread, wrap it in a towel.  It is astounding how effective a single layer of paper towel can be.  If the bread is rock hard, slightly dampen the towel, and use half-power--the warm bread will be soft and fresh.  Heat only briefly and/or at reduced power. &#62; You can even bake potatoes or roast ears of corn-on-the-cob in a microwave, if you wrap them in a damp cloth towel. &#62; Rinse vegetables before you cook them---that washes off any pesticides etc., and the extra water will produce extra steam.  If the vegies are dehydrated after long storage, you may want to soak them a few hours ahead to time to re-hydrate them. &#62; It is usually best NOT to boil vegies in a container of water in a microwave, because the excess formation of steam LOWERS the cooking temperature.  Your goal should be to create a little steam, contain it, and superheat it.  (This is the same principle as a pressure cooker). &#62; Stir some oil (e.g., olive) oil with cut vegetables---a coating of oil will help hold the steam inside the individual pieces of vegetable. &#62; A selection of glass casseroles of a range of sizes with glass lids can be essential for microwave cooking.  The goal is that the vegies fill the container and the container is covered with a lid---so that the steam is concentrated.
