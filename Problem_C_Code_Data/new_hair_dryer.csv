R3LY7MANJ71HBW,37151655,303775294,3,37,N,True,38,This Conair Is Full of Air,"Not as good as the original Conair 1875. Makeovers and upgrades don't always yield the best results. For instance, this 1875 replica. Lacks the basic functions a blow dryer should have, such as temperature adjustment. There is only a setting for high and low fan speed. Also, in order to use the air only feature with no heat, the cooling button has to be pressed and held down to use this basic function. This causes a person's fingers to get tired, holding a button over using a sliding switch. Then there is the retracted cord that is missing. That was probably the most valuable feature for the original Conair 1875. Made the dryer much more portable. Even useful when not traveling. Now the new 1875 has its cord sprawled all over the bathroom counter. The original is much better. This is slightly smaller with about 10 watts more power and a directional air controller, but overall not worth the investment.",8/27/2015,3,3.0

RH1COQMQTTTQK,14693093,127431946,3,1,Y,False,1,"Dries my thick, wavy hair quickly and thoroughly","I've owned like 3 or 4 blow driers in my time. I'm not so good about consistently using them because I'm lazy. Well, I also know how harsh blow-drying can be on hair (particularly colored like mine), so I tend to avoid it. But every so often (more so in the winter), I find I need to dry my hair quickly instead of waiting. My last hair dryer died in a blaze of glory - well, actually it more or less fizzled and refused to turn on. So when this popped up in my Vine selection, I selected it.<br /><br />This Remington hair dryer comes with attachments - one, a diffuser, that looks like an alien product (apparently used for curly hair), and a funnel appendage that reminds me of an airplane wind tunnel. I don't have curly hair so I didn't bother with the diffuser (I really wish it had not been included because all it does it take up valuable drawer space), but I did test out the Wind Tunnel (much as I like pretending it's a wind tunnel for miniature airplanes, I would like to know, what is this thing called really?).<br /><br />I love all the settings! My last hair dryer pretty much had hi-lo, hot-cold and that was it. This has 3 heat settings and 2 speeds along with a cold blast setting, allowing for a more controlled drying experience. I found it really dried my thick, wavy hair well (another reason why I hate drying my hair - it usually takes 30 minutes for it to be all dry) and relatively quickly. The Wind Tunnel also helped to ensure nice, smooth, straight hair - the way I like to style my hair.<br /><br />Overall, I'm impressed and pleased. I wish that the diffuser hadn't been included because I have no need for it and the space it takes up BUT I know that those with curly hair may appreciate it.<br /><br />UPDATE 09/18/16: While I still like this product, I have since received a Bio Ionic from Vine, which I like more. The Remington's Cool Burst is far too easily activated when I am drying my hair, a problem I don't have with the Bio Ionic.

I haven't noticed my strands being shiny or silky,  but the dryer dries quickly and isn't very loud.  I appreciate the different heat and speed settings. The barrel is longer than most other dryers I've used but it isn't hard to grip or control. It is boxed nicely and comes with a diffuser attachment. I would recommend this productIf you check out the pictures in other's reviews you'll see they have had luck with smooth, shiny hair. I have not gotten a chance to use it that much to see results and I've been using texturing product which also isn't conducive to smooth or shiny hair.",8/23/2015,5,5.0

It has an adjustable pole which is great when you have more than one person using it. It also has wheels so it is easy for me to roll it around the house. This is much better that the hooded dryer that I had to sit on the table and find a chair low enough so I could fit under the hood. I use my dryer on a weekly basis.

Another problem is the rocker switch design. When I'm using this, the rocker switch controls on the handle are very easy to push and I'm regularly having to reset my settings. After I while this gets very annoying.<br /><br />It seems to be lasting me pretty well. I've been using it almost one year and haven't had any trouble with its performance.

It has very solid cord connectors and circuit breaker protection built into the plug...excellent safety features!  The handle and controls are very well placed for ease of use.  They stay cool to the touch during use.  It has 2 speeds and 3 heat settings.  Low speed and low heat works best for us. It puts out a huge amount of hot air at high heat and high speed.

I used it twice, it dried my hair quickly and somewhat smooth using a ceramic ion brush.  I was pleased with the results, after all this was a big step up from the half broken one I purchased from Sally's years ago.  Then I visited my mother who recently purchased a new drier, the rusk w8less.  She told me I should try it.  When I used the rusk I was amazed at how fast it dried my hair and how  smooth and silky my hair felt.  I was in LOVE!!! It was a huge step up from the twinturbo.

R3Q1FG7H6RV3PX,42644737,127431946,4,2,Y,False,2,Nicely Designed 1875 Watt Blow Dryer That's Super Lightweight and A Great Value!,"This is a very good blow dryer. It has three heat and two speed settings, and a cool shot button to help set your style. It's 1875 watts- so it's nice and strong though not as powerful my professional hair dryer that does dry my hair faster. But my hair has been getting split ends and damaged, so I love that this dryer is designed to protect against heat damage. Only time will tell if that feature works, but I sure need it. This also has the usual attachments that I never use but they look the same as what typically comes with a blow dryer. My biggest problem with blow dryers is the motor dies from not regularly cleaning the lint filter (which draws in dust and causes the motor to overheat). So one great feature is this Remington has a removable filter for easy cleaning, and that will definitely prolong the life of the hair dryer if the filter is cleaned out regularly.<br /><br />My hair comes out smooth and nice with the Remington. My favorite part about the design is it's comfortable to hold, the controls are placed well for comfortable use and most of all it's super lightweight. Also, this dryer is not as loud as most others. It looks great in purple too. I do wish the cord was a little longer. It's long enough for plugging into a high outlet in a bathroom, but if I need to use a lower outlet in another room  then the cord is too short for me to stand and dry my hair (though adequate if I sit down). I'm used to a longer cord, so others may not mind the cord length, but I'm taking one star off as I think the cord should be at least a foot longer.

I've looked at this one online a few times but couldn't justify the price.  Then it  went on sale and I jumped on it.  Just got it, first use.  It's not silver, like the one pictured, but I didn't buy it for color so I don't care (mine is kind of a gunmetal black).  Beautifully packaged, easy to understand directions/ switches (and they should be- I'm drying my hair, not launching a rocket into space).  A bit heavier than my last dryer, but not uncomfortable.  I did notice a really mild chemical odor, but I was using the dryer on its highest setting and I'm guessing it had to do with the casing heating up.  The odor did go away and it was never overpowering and didn't make me think the dryer was going to explode in my hand or anything.  The dryer did NOT dry my thick, mid-back length hair in 5 minutes (as was claimed by another reviewer, I think) but it did SIGNIFICANTLY decrease my drying time.  Took about 22 minutes down from 40-50 (and would still have damp spots), and that was with a little extra time fiddling around styling because.....MY HAIR LOOKS AWESOME.  Seriously.  I could be in a hair products commercial right now, I'm not kidding.  I feel like my gorgeous hair is going to waste just sitting inside writing an Amazon review, but this baby deserves it so I sat right down to do it.  I would have NEVER believed a dryer would make so much difference (otherwise I'd have bought this ages ago), but truly, I look like I just walked out of the salon.  I want to stockpile these so I never have to live without it.  This was a phenomenal deal on sale, but I would pay full price (and then some) knowing what I know now.",8/15/2015,5,5.0

Three heat settings that feel like they should. Cold. Warm. Hot. Two speed settings, high and low. Very happy with the ease of selecting what I want, plus (again) the great air flow.<br /><br />A major plus is not having the high-pitch screeching whine of a Conair or so many other brands. For such power, the Allure 2200W is a relatively quiet dryer. On a noise scale of 10, I would venture to say between &#34;4&#34; and &#34;6,&#34; depending on the settings. For comparison, I would rate most Conairs and probably most other blow dryers I've used at between 7-10. Not dis'ing Conair, just mostly been using that brand for the past decade.<br /><br />My only wish is that the Allure buttons were on the right side (as opposed to facing inside toward your head), as I find the buttons a tad easy to inadvertently press.

(I know … I know … it’s the person not the tool.) When she dries it, she barely has to touch it up with a flat iron. When I dry it … I have to do a little more work to straighten out the wavy stragglers.<br /><br />This review compares the Revlon 1875W Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Dryer, Remington T|Studio Silk AC Professional Hair Dryer, and this one (Remington Damage Control (DC) Ceramic Hair Dryer).<br /><br />All of them have:<br />  * Same wattage<br />  * Three heat settings<br />  * Two speed settings<br />  * Cool shot feature<br />  * Diffuser and concentrator attachments<br />  * Ionic technology<br />  * Ceramic technology<br />  * Hanging loop<br /><br />The Revlon does not come with a removable filter, the two Remingtons do. (The TStudio doesn’t say it on the box or description. Company website confirms it.) Revlon and Remington Damage Control have tourmaline technology, the TStudio does not.<br /><br />The Revlon’s concentrator attachment stays on. The Remington’s fall off often. If I put the dryer down to adjust my hair, it comes off some of the time. It's hot to put it back on.<br /><br />All three take about the same time to dry my hair. I may have gotten slightly better results (less wavy) with the Remingtons than with the Revlon. I say “may” because the difference wasn’t large enough to be clear. Some days I do a better job than others. Human error, you know.<br /><br />The Damage Control felt like it took less effort and the reason is most likely because it’s the lightest of the three. The shell of the DC and Revlon are plastic while the T|Studio uses better quality materials. But it could be the better quality materials that make it heavier.<br /><br />I can only assume the DC is cheaper than the T|Studio because of its plastic shell even though it has tourmaline technology, which the T|Studio does not.<br /><br />I’ve yet to try the diffusers.

R1R3GIK98PJKXC,42838127,593915883,5,2,N,False,4,Hands down...BEST hair dryer I've ever used.,"A hair dryer is not something I generally replace until I need it.  Mine is still working,  but I had been saying for a while that I needed a new one.  I've always just looked at it as something that blows air and that they are all pretty much the same.  After using this one a few times,  I will never say that again.  This hair dryer is awesome.  I had already switched my curling irons to ionic ceramic and could tell a big difference,  but I didn't realize that it would also make a difference in a hair dryer.  Not only does it dry my hair faster,  but it leaves it looking much more healthy.  I have very long hair and even though I take good care of it,  I had noticed that it was looking dull and dry.  The first time I used this dryer,  I could tell a difference.  I don't know all the &#34;how&#34; or &#34;why&#34; reasons,  but I do know that my hair didn't look or feel like all the moisture had been stripped from it.  I had even started to air dry my hair because I could see what was happening to it,  but that takes a long time with thick , long hair.  I will still air dry when I have the time,  but now I feel like I can dry my hair quickly (and this dryer does it VERY quick),  and not be damaging it.  I don't use the high heat on this one because it's very hot and my fine hair wouldn't like that,  but I like knowing that the option is there if needed.  The air flow with this is massive.....really powerful... When on high,  I can dry my hair in a few minutes,  but that's only when I'm just drying it to put in a ponytail.  Medium is more than enough airflow to dry and style it, and I love the cool setting.  When I used a round brush to curl,  I finished with the cool setting and it made all the difference.  It's not a small dryer,  but it's not at all heavy ,  especially considering the power that it contains.<br />  They include a little card explaining that their products are made by women.

R26WEFZNWAJXN,50899130,258419037,5,4,N,False,4,Choosing the perfect hair dryer (A saga),"I am 58 years old and have mid-length, medium texture, slightly wavy hair.<br />For the past 15 years I have been using the same Conair hairdryer (it just will not die) an average of 2-3x a week and over that time have had my share of good hair days and bad.<br />Recently, I've noticed that my hair has been getting very dry - even in the summer which is very unusual.<br />So, after trying various shampoos with not much difference, I decided to Google 'dry hair' and low and behold, hair dryers popped up! I don't think I would have come up with that on my own, so of course I then started researching hair dryers. There are about as many 'Top Ten Hair Dryer' lists as I think there are hair dryers! While there are a couple of (pricey) brands that tend to show up on most of those lists, I finally decided to look at it a different way ie: what 'technologies' exist and what would work best with my hair. I like a lot of volume and smoothness, so ionic, ceramic, tourmaline with infra red seemed to fit the bill - which is everything this dryer has. I read pretty much all of the reviews, watched the YouTube videos and even tho' people complained about the weight and button positions, I decided to give it a try. Well, I have to say that I am literally blown away! First, I understand why people complain about the button position as the first time I used it, I also kept changing speed and heat settings. However, it took me no time at all to figure out how to hold it so that doesn't happen. The heat levels are nice and consistent and the Cool Shot button works great - doesn't 'lock' but I don't care as I just shoot the roots before I finish each section so works fine for me. Regarding the weight, that was the only thing that I was a bit concerned about at first, since my old dryer was super light.  Now, after using it for the second time, I didn't even notice the weight, only the incredibly awesome results it produces! I actually feel like I have new hair as it is no longer dry and frizzy but instead is super smooth, soft and bouncy. I still can't believe changing hair dryers could make such a difference. I actually look forward to doing my hair now! My recommendation is, do your research, but if you have hair similar to mine, give this fantastic dryer a try - I don't think you'll be disappointed!frizzy but instead is super smooth, soft and bouncy.

I am so happy because the vent on my old one was sucking my hair inside and I would have to break by hair to get it out.<br /><br />This hairdryer is very nice and durably constructed. It feels substantial in my hands, not flimsy and cheap. It comes with 2 diffuser type attachments that connects easily and stay in place until you take them off.<br /><br />The cord on this hairdryer is super long so I can move around quite a bit while drying my hair. There is also a loop built in the handle so this hair dryer can be hung up for storage purposes.<br /><br />The hairdryer itself has a cool shot button which you hold down if you want cool air to blow out. There is another button that changes the forcefulness of the air that is blowing out (this one has 2 settings). The last button is high, medium and low for the warmth of the heat that will blow out of the hair dryer.<br /><br />This hair dryer is 1875 watts so it is pretty powerful and it dries my hair pretty quickly. The infrared light actually is an orange red color and it helps to reduce static and frizz.<br /><br />I am very impressed with this hair dryer and I wish I would have gotten it sooner.<br /><br />I received this product free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.",7/28/2015,5,5.0

IT COULD SAVE YOU FROM BEING BUYING A DEFECTIVE ITEM THAT COULD BURN YOU!<br /><br />When I opened up the package, the packing for the blow-dryer was bent and looked open. Despite that, I thought maybe it just got damaged from shipping. When I opened up the package, it looked used. The blowdryer itself and the attachments (especially the diffuser) were all scratched; almost like they were used. Still, I thought, &#34;Maybe this was just a packaging issue and got damaged via UPS or during the shipping process.&#34; I wanted to test out the product before returning it. I severely regret even trying out this item before returning it.<br /><br />I plugged in the blow-dryer and attached the diffuser attachment. It didn't seem to blow air very well at all. My $25 Conair blow-dryer actually blows out more air than this did! I only had the blow-dryer plugged in for maybe a minute and realized it just didn't work. I actually got burnt because the diffuser got so hot! I now have a little welt on me from accidentally touching it. I can easily seeing this blow-dryer causing a fire or really harming somebody! I will never buy a 'Pro Beauty Tools' item again. The fact that this item was even labeled as a &#34;professional,&#34; blow-dryer is a joke. It blows no air and is cheaply made. The supposed $150 value is a joke, as well. Like I said, my $25 Conair blow-dryer is much, much better than this joke of a dryer<br /><br />Now I have no blow-dryer, a mini welt and irritated skin. Save your time, physical health and money and buy something else. Like I said, I can really see this endangering somebody -- whether by burning them severely (I wasn't even using the dryer for 2 minutes before becoming burnt) or causing a fire of some sort.

R1IP82KZJT56JA,13653921,732252283,3,2,N,True,2,The good: For the most part,"I bought this hair dryer because my last one finally died after about 5 years. I was looking for something inexpensive and high quality, which often doesn't go together.<br /><br />The good: For the most part, this dryer does exactly what it says it will. It dried my hair slightly faster than my previous dryer, and left it frizz free. I have very fine hair, so it almost always gets poofy. The tapered end made it easier to target the air to the rolling brush, which makes a big difference when compared to a snub nosed dryer (those aren't professional beauty terms, just the best words I can think of to describe the product). It's a decent size and easy to store. The motor is VERY quiet compared to other hair dryers I've used. My boyfriend gets up an hour later than I do for work, and he definitely appreciates the quiet motor.<br /><br />The bad: Just an aesthetic thing, it smells weird. To be fair, it's brand new so it's probably the smell from the packaging; but it also produces a faint odor when the motor runs that reminds me of like a toy blow dryer. I'll update the review if the smell goes away. For it's average size, it's fairly heavy. I'm not sure if it's because a larger motor, heavier materials, etc. I was using it for about 10 mins and my arm started to get sore! It's not insanely heavy, definitely manageable, but I would give it a higher ranking if it was a lighter and easier to hold. Also, the controls operate opposite any dryer I've ever had. So, instead of sliding the control up to get a faster speed or hotter temp, you slide down. That has definitely taken some getting used to. Finally, the attachments are just OK. They connect to the dryer well, but if you're like me, you are kind of a klutz when blow drying your hair. I usually knock the dryer with my brush or my hand at some point during the drying process and the attachments fall off at the slightest bump.<br /><br />Overall - it does what it says it will and does fine for what I paid for it. In hindsight, I wish I would've splurged another 10 or 20 bucks for something nicer.ight, I wish I would've splurged another 10 or 20 bucks for something nicer.",7/25/2015,3,3.0

It's not so heavy that you won't want to use it, and it's surprisingly compact.<br /><br />You get two attachments, a concentrator nozzle, which if you've never used one before is amazing for keeping your hair smooth and silky.  You get a finger diffuser as well; which is great for curly hair or waves without the frizz.  I've never been able to blow dry my hair and get curls that I love up until now.  Normally my hair is a big ball of frizz after blowdrying it, but I was able to get frizz free curls with the help of this diffuser.<br /><br />I straighten my hair frequently and for the longest time I had to let my hair dry overnight because blow drying my hair would just cause it to frizz and even using a straightener wouldn't get rid of the frizz.  Now I just use the concentrator nozzle and it really helps keep the frizz at bay when I want to blow dry it straight.  Quite possibly my favorite thing about this blow dryer is the fact that not only does it have a cool shot button, it has a COOL setting, I have A LOT of hair and holding down that cool shot button for my whole hair can be a pain, now I can just switch it to the cool setting. Overall, I love this blow dryer, it's the best one I've ever owned.<br /><br />I received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.",7/25/2015,5,5.0

R2LZRK0M3BNLEX,15655878,453645026,5,9,N,True,9,"Professional-quality hair dryer with options that are perfect for fine, short hair, and at a terrific price point","My old Con-Air finally bit the dust. I had been impressed with my hair stylist's hair dryer, but I knew such an expensive unit was out of my budget. However, I was willing to spend a little more than $20 on a drugstore hair dryer that, hopefully, would last a bit longer this time. I have very short, very, very fine hair. When it was longer, I used to require a diffuser since it is naturally wavy; however, with my current pixie cut, I knew I only really needed a unit that came with a concentrator nozzle. Because of the short-length and fineness of my hair, I also wanted a unit that had a good range of temperatures and speeds. A lot of what's available on the market now is too hot and too powerful for my hair. I did a bit of research for hair dryers that matched my criteria and finally settled on this. The extremely positive reviews left by other Amazon customers gave me confidence I had made a good decision.<br /><br />Happily enough, turns out I was correct! This unit feels solid. It is well-constructed, and doesn't have the &#34;hot spots&#34; like my old Con-Air did that caused its paint to flake off everywhere. It is a touch heavier than my old dryer, but I like the way it feels in my hand. The bit of added weight does not make the unit any more difficult to use. It is also powerful! The motor on this dryer is of much better quality than any I've used previously, causing an increase of air throughput that allows the unit to dry hair very quickly. Paradoxically, this unit performs much better than any 1875 W hair dryer I've ever used, and yet it is much, much quieter, and range of airflows gives it finesse. It comes with 3 different temperature settings and 3 different airflow settings, and I have found the medium temperature and medium airflow to be perfect for my needs. If you use the highest temperature setting, it will get hot! So if you need the high temp and high power, it is definitely there for you. It also comes with a concentrator nozzle, the output width of which in my opinion, is the perfect length. Some nozzles tend to be exorbitantly wide, which is probably fine if you have a lot of hair. But the output width of this nozzle is only around 2&#34;, perfect for a shortie like me.<br /><br />What more can I say? I am extremely happy with this purchase. It does arrive in a box that looks like it came straight out of the late 80s/early 90s, which I just found to be humorous. It is very no-muss, no-fuss, and I don't even think mine had packaged instructions with it. But it works just as well as my stylist's professional dryer and at a terrific price point. I would buy again in a heartbeat (but hopefully I won't have to, at least for a long, long time).",7/23/2015,5,5.0

The Remington AC2015 does its job nice and quickly.<br /><br />I have long (almost waist length), thick, and very straight hair. I wash them every 2-3 days using natural products (Lush shampoo and conditioner), and also oil them a couple times a week (Jojoba oil + either rosemary or lavender essential oil). I use a wooden brush - but only when they're dry. So yes, I really love and care for my hair! But when it comes to drying them, I can't imagine to spend a lot of time doing it. My drying routine is simple: 1) I remove most of the water with a towel (gently) and use my fingers to remove tangles; 2) then I blow-dry my hair upside down; 3) finally, I brush them. The whole procedure takes me approx. 15 minutes, using the maximal power (level 3) and heat (again 3) of the hair dryer.<br /><br />My husband has way shorted and fewer hair than I do, straight and thin. He uses my same shampoo and conditioner, but won't do anything more than that. He wouldn't need to use a hair dryer, but love the feeling. It takes him less than a minute to be perfectly dry.<br /><br />My dog is a Scottish Terrier - so she's small but has longish and super thick fur. We wash her in the bathtub with natural Castille soap. To dry her fur, we first wrap her in a towel, and remove most of the water, then we use the hair dryer alternating medium heat (level 2) and cold air to avoid burning her skin. When she starts being somewhat dryer, we use her brush to attack the most hidden hair (e.g. armpits). It takes us approx. 1 hour.<br /><br />To sum up, this hair dryer is durable and high quality - a great bang for the buck!",7/18/2015,5,5.0

Don't dry your hair all the way (if it's curly) The frizz will erase all the work you just did.<br />2. Place your hair cradled in the dryers teeth and THEN turn it on. Hold for as long as you need, then turn the dryer off before moving to a new section. Any time this dryer is not full of hair and right up next to your scalp, it's making a frizz mess.<br />3. After drying 75% of the way, stop and clip up your roots to avoid flat head. I find that the hair next to my scalp is still a little damp and susceptible to flatness.<br /><br />It's a fine dryer, and I use it occasionally when I'm in a hurry, but for curly hair (I'm a 2c/3a with fine hair) I find it's always best to air dry.",7/16/2015,4,4.0

As other reviewers have stated the area of cord where it comes out of the handle wears out and short circuits causing pops, sparks and fire! This happened after 1 year of use almost to the day. I live alone and use it once/day mostly on high heat. The problem is obviously a cheap cord that when bent back and forth enough times will wear the wire enough to short out. This is not a fluke but  bad design components. When I compare the cord to other dryers I clearly see the difference in cord. This cord has more of a softer  rubber feel and a dull dark color, where proper cords have a shiny finish and more of a hard vinyl feel. Believe me this will happen to all of these units eventually if you use the high heat settings daily.

Later that day I started wondering why it hadn't blown a breaker and decided that possible lint had accumulated and touched the burner wire. I did clean out some lint and turned on the dryer to see if I had solved problem. No!  After about 10 seconds smoke came out, there was a burning smell, and the handle got hot.

I went to Italy so I set the switch for 220v before I left so I wouldn't forget.  The first time I plugged it in (with an adapter), I double checked to ensure it was set to 220.  I switched it on low and it was working fine.  I then switched it on high, and within seconds it became red hot.  I looked at it and immediately pulled the plug as it was just about to shoot flames.  When I looked at the voltage, it had changed back to 110.  With the dryer unplugged, I set it back to 220 and toggled the hi/lo switch.  What I realized is that it worked fine on the low setting.  The moment the setting was changed to hi, it also changed the voltage back to 110.  Once I got this figured out, I used it on low for the entire trip with no issues.  Low was enough to dry my shoulder length hair.",7/5/2015,3,3.0

I live in humid south Florida and have shoulder length thick hair that tends to frizz.  I have always taken care to dry my hair carefully and thoroughly with a round brush; however, after a stint in the Florida heat I am all frizz again.  I decided to upgrade my hair dryer and read many reviews before selecting this one.  I do have to add that most of the recommended hair dryers were priced well over $50 which just seems like too much to me.  The Remington AC9096 had both great reviews and a reasonable price and best of all -- IT WORKS.  I can dry my hair very quickly with this dryer using a large round brush and the end result is soft, smooth, shiny, frizz-free hair that stays frizz free even when I am outdoors.  I have not had any issues with my hair getting caught on the dryer, but like I said,  my hair is only shoulder length. If you have hair that tends to frizz in the humidity,  buy this dryer.

R37007IH78PMRG,23509730,814216548,5,1,N,False,1,Incredible dryer!,"We found this at a local store just looking for a cheep hair dryer, and I have to say that I am incredibly impressed with its performance. We have had this running for a minimum of three hours straight and it hasn't skipped a beat! First time we used it, we forgot to press the cool air button and ended up melting PVC pipe, so as far as heat goes, this thing is awesome. Its heat resistance is also pretty impressive! We have had it right up next to  about 1200° F and it kept working (it had a bit of distance from the heat since we connected it to PVC pipe, but the PVC funneled heat right into the dryer when it was off). Today we even had it next to about 1300° F and not a thing went wrong! So all in all we have ran this in pretty intense environments and it hasn't failed us yet. We've ran it 4 times like this and it was able to preform perfectly each time. Only problem we had was that at around hour 2 the first time we used it, the back started to smoke. We thought that maybe we had bought a cheep dryer and that we'd need a different one, but soon after it stopped and hasn't done it since. We were using it in a small drizzle which might impact performance, so don't use it for 2 hours in a slight drizzle. Once it started really raining, we moved into a garage and continued using it, and after that it stopped smoking. But all in all I'd say that it is a very good purchase for a low price.

Other dryers I've had have produced still slightly warm heat even when the cool button is used.  Not this one!!!!  The downside for this dryer is the diffuser attachment.  It is much too small and does not diffuse well enough to not have my fine 2 b/c wavy hair not blow all over.

R343JSO3O9K2IC,10286748,646149518,5,53,N,True,57,"Incredible dryer!  Fast, soft and shiny hair!","Wow.  Honestly, I was a bit skeptical about whether there would be any difference between this hairdryer and the $20 ones I have been using my whole life.  I couldn't be more wrong!  This dryer is truly head and shoulders above anything I've tried before.  Please read on to hear about the technology, results and how to properly use this should you be convinced to take the plunge!<br /><br />The Technology<br />Rather amazing technology here from the engineers at Panasonic.  Using a high electric potential they create negative ions which trap water molecules from the air and combine them with the hot air jet of a conventional dryer.  By doing this, they buffer the air jet with moisture which in turn prevents damage to hair.  Panasonic has been leaders in this area of technology which is why Japan enjoys the best selection of such hair dryers.<br /><br />The Results<br />As other reviewers have pointed out, hair is dried quicker and with softer, shinier results!  My hair is short, but for most women with longer hair, the results should be even better!  It is designed to run cooler to protect hair from heat, so if you dry your hair everyday you would significantly reduce cumulative damage to hair.<br /><br />Before you use:<br />You must be aware of the electrical requirements for using this fine hair dryer.  Since it was designed for the Japanese domestic market, it is made for their electrical system, not the U.S.  Although the plugs in Japan and the U.S. look the same, the electricity supply is very different.  I am an electrical engineer and I have lived in Japan, continue to use many Japanese products in the U.S. so I understand the differences well and how to work around them.  In Japan they use 100 volts, however in the U.S. we use 120 volts.  That means by plugging in a Japanese product directly into the U.S. system, you would overload the product by 20%.  For a high wattage device like a hair dryer that is a considerable amount over the intended design!  Indeed some other reviewers have posted pictures of melted dryers and claimed they were defective.  However, if properly used this should not happen.  In fact, I noticed that when I use mine, the hair dryer itself stays quite cool.<br /><br />See my pictures below which show the electric sticker saying 100v (if it were ok for U.S. it would have a range that included 120v).  I have also posted 2 pictures of my dryer plugged in to a transformer.  Note the first one with the power off, my voltage reader measures 105volts (this is close enough to 100v).  The second one has the power on, and it is consuming 1148 watts.  (That is more than many microwaves, so you can imagine with 20% overload why people were experiencing bad smells, melting and early failure!)<br /><br />I warn that a proper stepdown transformer (capable of at least 1200 watts minimum for this dryer) will be expensive.  But used within its capacity will last forever.  I personally recommend Japanese made transformers from companies such as Sanyo, Nissyo or Toyozumi.  I have heard poor quality control on Chinese made ones, so given the high cost of the dryer (or any other Japanese product you would consider, i.e. Panasonic Nanocare steamer) I would invest in the best transformer.  Furthermore, I would not hesitate to purchase a Japanese transformer used on eBay as these are very durable items and you can often get a great deal (they come up from time-to-time.)<br /><br />5 stars!  When used properly will provide incredibly healthy looking hair!d some other reviewers have posted pictures of melted dryers and claimed they were defective.

Not until you go to $100+, and when your comparing a 100$ hair dryer to a 20$ one, the 20$ one is the hairdryer to go with.  Update: retractable cord doesn't always fully retract. Still works fine. I would have liked an easier to clean one but this works. I use my shop vac to demolish the lint in the rear fan. For the price it's still a good bargain.",6/20/2015,4,4.0

I admit that I love to buy beauty products, but especially hair products. My hair is colored/highlighted, fairly straight, but not thin. Lately I keep buying products to take the dry frizz that seems to appear on the ends of my hair. Little did I know that using the Conair Tourmaline Hair Dryer would solve that problem immediately. The dryer has settings for the usual hot/cold/warm settings and high/medium/low...but it's nice to have the controls slide on either side of the device. It's a powerful 1875 watts that dries my hair faster with ions and gives it body plus takes away the dry ends almost 100%. My co-workers noticed my hair looking better too.

Yes, the<br />controls can easily get flipped around, but the temp and<br />air flow is ideal for those of us with super fine  and fragile<br />curly hair.  Whatever they are doing to these ion hairdryers<br />is nothing desirable for me.

This was solved by placing a strip of Velcro on the inside of each &#34;ear&#34;.  Would have given product 5 stars if this had not occurred. Found that this easy &#34;repair&#34; needs to be repeated every couple of years.<br /><br />From my experience, definitely would not hesitate to recommend. Conjecture is that those who experienced short life with this appliance may not have cleaned the lint filter as often as required. From personal experience I know it's easy to put this little chore off. If you have had this product only a few months and you start experiencing the unit shutting off before your hair is dry - this is the thing to check.",6/7/2015,4,4.0

R3VBFZ0XMR61MY,22388771,443954263,4,0,N,True,0,Very Surprised,Purchased the Onei MK-II to replace my wigo. After purchasing a Chi & Sedu I was hesitant to purchase the Onei. This by far has surpassed my expectations & my experience with the Chi & Sedu. I need a hairdryer to meet my needs: dry without loss of volume & decrease amount/use of root/shine styling products. Very surprised at how gentle the air flow comes out & how fast my hair dries.  I assume it's based on the barrel shape of the Onei dryer vs a more cylindrical barrel like some dryers. The packaging of the dryer far exceeded my expectations. The quality of the Onei feels/looks better than the sedu I purchased months ago. So far very surprised & looking to see if this will outlast my last dryer a wigo(5yrs).  I have had this dryer for only a month & have not heard of this brand before. That's why I only gave it a 4.

After my favorite dryer broke, I looked for one like it that is lightweight, has power but not too much power, and most importantly, has the high/low/off switch on the BACK of the dryer handle, not in the front.  All of the dryers I have looked at in the past have the switch(es) on the front of the handle.  This is a problem for me, because when I style my hair with a dryer and a round brush, I have to constantly turn the dryer on and off.  With the buttons on the back of the handle like this one, I can turn it on and off with one hand.  When the buttons are on the front of the handle, I have to set my brush down to turn it on and off with two hands.  What a hassle!  This lightweight dryer with the on/off switch on the back of the handle fits the bill perfectly.  I will probably buy another one as a back-up for when this one wears out.

R199FV0NDPDG4R,52290874,619941271,5,85,N,False,89,New Curlipops Pancake Style Dryer Beats the Competition,"I’m better impressed with the Curlipops Diffuser Dryer than I was with my deceased Conair Curl Fusion Ionic Ceramic Styler Hair Dryer (next to current generation) which the Curlipops is replacing for me. Both dryers have negative ionic technology, which makes them preferable to the free hairdryers at hotels, the gym, and my therapy pool, as I always notice much more frizz when I use those dryers than when I use my own. So, in that regard, they’re both preferable IMO.<br /><br />Unlike the Conair, the Curlipops allows you to position the diffuser the way you want to, and for me that’s so that there aren’t large gaps between the dryer fan and your hair. It may be that I have a heightened sense of safety awareness, after working in health care for 38 years, but the Conair’s clipping on in a way that kept the gaps as wide as possible didn’t give me a whole lot of confidence that it would work well for “pixiecurling.” For those who don’t know, this is a method of drying curly hair, developed by someone who goes by “pixiecurl” on naturallycurly.com, in which you scrunch your hair into the bowl of a dryer’s diffuser with the dryer off, turn it on and dry that section of hair, then turn it off before repositioning the dryer: because the dryer isn’t on when you do the scrunching, curls stay better defined, but another factor is that your hair isn’t being pushed away by airflow when you’re positioning the dryer, only possibly an issue with a pancake style dryer. I was still too chicken to try it with pixiecurling, but used the method Jessica McGuinty (of Jessicurl) uses in her hair drying video &#60;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyyOypbTHI0&#62;, and it worked great! My hair dried a lot faster, curled really well, and I had no problems with frizz as it finished drying. Although it’s a little difficult to attach initially, the diffuser works really well, and that’s no biggie since I have no reason to keep removing and reattaching it, it just resides on the dryer. So one for Curlipops.<br /><br />It has three heat settings: cool, warm, and hot, which are independent of the airflow speed, as well as having a cool shot button. I don’t use high speed because it disorganizes my curls. I’m also unlikely to use hot, but it’s nice to have the option of finishing with cool air without having to hold the cool shot button down for an extended period of time. The Conair has Hi, Off, and Lo, along with a cool shot button, so airspeed and heat, or lack thereof, are connected to each other, and I score another one for the Curlipops.<br /><br />Whine: the Conair has it in spades, and the Curlipops has very little. So I give this one to the Curlipops too.<br /><br />Both dryers are listed as having the same weight, according to Amazon, though that’s really the shipping weight. It’s a little more than I’d like, considering I have fibromyalgia, and I don’t need any help making my arms and shoulders ache, but it’s still better than getting hypothermia, pneumonia, or bronchitis. Also, not having the dryer permanently attached to a wall means I can get into more comfortable positions while drying my hair. Both still weigh less than my mother’s non-ionic, folding, travel dryer, which I used once while I was moving her, then abandoned due to the abundant halo of frizz it created. So score one for both pancake dryers. However, neither one has dual voltage, and the Curlipops’s instructions specifically state it should not be used with a voltage converter, so it would not be a possible choice for travel outside of North America.Curlipops.<br /><br />It has three heat settings: cool, warm, and hot, which are independent of the airflow speed, as well as having a cool shot button.

With other hair dryers it takes anywhere from 25-35 minutes but this one literally takes 7-10 minutes plus adds more volume to my hair.The heat settings are perfect as well in case someone doesn't want to add too much heat to your hair .. Every dryer I have ever owned did pretty much all the same things but at the end made my hair frizzy and dried my hair out. This dryer is THE ONLY ONE that makes my hair look so beautiful, sleek, soft and shiny! It makes my hair so smooth that I almost don't have to flat iron it since it is naturally wavy.

FIt and finish is as good as the Chi. Logical button placement and function is perfect. Temps are ideal, force is great and the whole hairdryer feels like a salon professional.

My only complaint is one that I have heard from other viewers - the control buttons are somewhat awkward.  I have had to get used to holding this dryer in a different way than I've always held all other hairdryers.

I was impressed immediately with this dryer.  It is beautiful.  It is slightly heavier than my last one,  but it cut drying time considerably so I don't think this will be an issue.  It has three speeds.  It has three temperature settings. The highest is hotter than any blow dryer i have ever used.  I just dried my hair with it and my naturally wavy hair is so straight that I don't need to break out my flat iron. Yes, I am amazed by this thing! The medium heat setting is equivalent to my last dryers hottest setting.  I have twin daughters that are young and I think the only setting cool enough to dry their hair with is the lowest heat Setting. This dryer is so powerful,  yet a ton quieter than my previous dryer. My husband even commented on how quiet it is. My husband also liked the fact that it is heavier.  Being a mechanic he said it probably has a stronger,  more durable motor. I was reading the booklet that was included, and this dryer has a four year warranty.  That's pretty astounding considering the price point.

I had a 20% of coupon at that big bed and bath store. It was 99.99 so I got a good deal. It is a solid hair dryer and solid made. Made in Italy. Good blow and not too hot means hair dries faster with less damage. With good technique can leave hair silky soft. Not as defrizzing as my Volare though. And it feels heavier to me. So my Volare will remain my baby. It is better than the Elchim 2001, the $300 T3,  $200 CHI and an FHI dryer that I tried. I have super long wavy hair, live in the Bay Area, and I don't get haircuts often enough, so I need the anti-frizz. Also I am not great at blowdrying hair so I need the idiot proof anti-frizzer.<br /><br />It is not as good as my Volare V2 by Babyliss with the Ferrari AC motor (paid $70 more for).

My old blowdryer was awkward to work with and weak, and I would only blow dry my hair for special occasions.  Now I blow dry my hair every time it's washed.  My blow-dry time has been cut in half with this blow dryer.  It's much more powerful than similarly priced blow dryers.  It has a long, sturdy power cord, which makes the dryer easier to maneuver around to dry and style your hair.  It comes with a nozzle but not a diffuser, so if you use a diffuser you'll need to purchase one separately.",5/9/2015,5,5.0

Was searching for a new hair dryer as my hot tools dryer was giving off a burning smell and really drying out my hair. I decided on xtava because of the good reviews and so glad I purchased it.  The nozzle for the dryer stays firmly in place which is fantastic since when I tried to use one on my previous dryers, it would always fall off.  My hair comes out super smooth.  It is very powerful and not super noisy. Another great feature is the removable back to clean out lint! I was also really impressed with the welcome letter from the company I received via email after I received the dryers with tips on blow drying my hair. Would definitely recommend this dryer to anyone I know.",5/8/2015,5,5.0

Then I need to use the flat iron to calm it all down. With this hair dryer I had it completely dry in 10 minutes. When I use it with the Goody Quikstyle brush my hair is smooth enough that I only have to touch up a couple places with the flat iron. I live in the Deep South. Heat and humidity are a way of life. I can't tell you how happy I am with a hair dryer that cuts 10 - 20 minutes off the time I have to spend blowing more hot air my way.<br />Also, I have received two very service minded emails from the company.

Also, the filter is not easily accessible, like with some hair dryers that have a trap door that opens so you can reach them.

(Med-length wavy hair),"I realized a bit too late in my adult life that a good blow-dryer makes all the difference in the look and feel of your hair. I simply could not figure out why my hair was always kind of &#34;sticky&#34; and not quite fully dry when I got out of the shower and tried to dry my hair with my 5+ year old Conair that I bought at CVS very inexpensively.<br />I did some research online and scoffed at the $150+ dryers that were being promoted. This one was on the list, and honestly, given the relatively lower price point versus the other professional dryers, I was willing to try it out.<br />WOW. I have used it now about 3 times, and it is hard to believe what a significant difference I see in my hair. I styled it myself for a formal Gala event, and was able to achieve the shiny look, feel, and volume in my hair that any professional stylist could achieve. It was unreal. Even on a work day I feel so much better about myself having simply styled my hair with this blow dryer. It targets the hot hair wonderfully and leaves my hair so dry, shiny and healthy.<br />I went back and ordered one to send to my mom! She is also a victim of ignorance-to-bad-dryer-itis, so I went ahead and sent her the cure.<br />Happy Drying!",4/15/2015,5,5.0

Turbos are found on internal combustion engines, both gasoline and diesel. If 'turbo' is meant to mean something like &#34;strong wind&#34;, they should have used a word like Kyōfū, which is Japanese for &#34;strong wind&#34;. Or maybe the German word for &#34;hair dryer&#34;, which is föhn. Either way, don't be fooled. There is no actual turbo, &#34;quiet fan and motor&#34; is subjective. It is loud.

That I could deal with but that was just one small detail.  The attachment for the hair curling I could not work, although that may just be me.  The settings for the hot and cold on this are right at the finger tips where you hold the dryer.  Therefore, if you are not careful you will be drying on warm instead of high.  You start wondering why its not getting dry.  I have had to change it back as many as 20 times in one hair drying session.  And now the last and & most frustrating feature of the dryer.  The concentrated hair drying attachment that was stated in the description of the product as coming off for easy cleaning, unlike most other models.  Well yes, it does come off for easy cleaning alright, it just blows it across the room as you are drying your hair.  You just don't want anyone else in the room with you for you never know where the line of fire may be.  It blows off with quite a force so I am sure it would hurt someone, particularly a small child.  I owned a Vidal Sassoon Dryer before but never one like this.  I cannot recommend this product and will not purchase another one of this brand.  It was inexpensive so I guess its true, you get what you pay for.

This hair dryer is really not my favorite. I usually hold it by the base when I'm drying a client's hair but it gets so hot that I have to hold it by the handle, but when I do that I'm touching all the buttons and turning stuff on and off on accident. Also, the part that holds the filter on the back of the dryer keeps falling off that I had to tape it and now it looks terrible but it's the only thing that holds the piece on. Not to mention the metal grate on the back that holds the filter in keeps caving in constantly. I feel like these are not meant for travel, which is funny because it's travel size. Maybe I got a bad batch or something.<br /><br />Yes it's a powerful driver, but this seems more like it's aimed at a consumer than a professional which is sad because I had many professionals reccomend it to me.

What attracted me to this Andis was the &#34;salon grade&#34; and the ionic/ceramic attributes. Overall this is a good hair dryer, but it doesn't blow as hard as the Conair it replaced. This was HUGE for me, as I like a good air flow. It takes longer for my wife to dry her hair because of it, so we went back to our old brand. It does, however, leave your hair &#34;silkier&#34; which was a surprise to me. I didn't think an ionic dryer could do that, but it does. The two settings it has for wattage didn't seem to make much of a difference, but it's a nice touch. I'm sure there's a reason for the option, but I can't think of anything it's useful for. I put it on the high setting and let it go. The retractable cord is nice, but it doesn't reel the cord all the way in, leaving about 16in left dangling. After a few weeks of use, it reels in even less, now leaving about 20 or so inches hanging.<br /><br />Pro: Silky hair, somewhat retractable cord, two wattage settings (that I'll prob never use).<br />Con: Takes longer to dry long, thick hair as the air current isn't as strong as I'd like.<br /><br />I wouldn't buy this again or recommend it, but if you don't mind a slightly weaker air flow, the ionic silkiness is worth it.",4/8/2015,2,2.0

I found it to be like most of the drug-store blowers in my blower-graveyard in the closet, going to the next garage sale. I just did not meet the expectations, not enough blow, heat and I still had frizzy static hair. It works and probably works just fine for those who have thick hair they don't want to damage, but my hair takes 2 minutes flat to dry and style.

It became easier to wrangle when I bought Velcro ties for the cord (On Amazon: VELCRO Brand - ONE-WRAP Thin Self-Gripping Cable Ties: Reusable, Light Duty - 8&#34; x 1/2&#34; Ties, 100 Pack - Black)<br /><br />Speed of drying: I can't say much here. After all, it is just blowing hot air, but I guess that I can say that it dries quickly.<br /><br />Temperature: The hot setting gets pretty hot. Not hot enough to burn your scalp, but hot enough to get the job done.",4/2/2015,3,4.0

R3BT577QV2MMH6,34473470,74735317,2,3,N,True,4,Works Great!  Well it did for awhile.,"Has a good volume of air on high for a compact unit, but the trade-off is it is a bit noisy too.  Not mention in the listing, but the blue button is a cool air button and works as would be expected.  Unlike the Revlon Rvdr5033 I had the cool button on this unit just turns the heat off and back on when released and does not change the fan.  It gets very hot on high and so did the Revlon.  Too hot it seems to me but it appears no one makes a 1500 watt model anymore.  I could find nothing but 1875 watt models even in compact.  Not pictured or mentioned but this one like all of them has the huge block on the cord end with a GFI and AC plug as part of that block.  Even though they tell you not to put two GFI's on the same circuit and there hasn't been a house built in almost 40 years without a GFI covering any outlet in every bathroom the requirement for this still persists.  I like that you can easily take the cover of the fan in the rear for cleaning.  Not many of the compact models seem to have that feature.  Overall a good unit.  Time will tell how durable and long lasting it is.  I can only hope it is as good in that area as the one it replaced.  Update 7/21/15: Well it is NOT very long lasting.  About 4 months in it suddenly started smoking and got very hot very fast did some nice sparking and arcing, then quit.  We will see if they honor the warranty.",4/2/2015,2,2.0

I am very pleased with this purchase.  I have fine shoulder length hair and it did not take an hour to dry, as another reviewer stated.  (Of course, I didn't attempt to dry my hair when it is dripping wet either.  I wrap my hair in a towel and do other things for a while before attempting to blow dry.)  Anyway, I was worried at first because the packaging and most of the instructions are in Japanese.  But I used it on the lower voltage and it was fine.  I used the regular brush to dry my hair, as I'm not sure how to use the round brush yet.  I dried most of my hair and then used this upside down to give my hair some lift and bounce, which it did.  Also, my hair does not look frizzy, like it does at times when using a regular blow dryer (I believe because sometimes a regular blow dryer both damages and tends to tangle your hair).  My hair actually looks shiny as well as smooth (as if I flat ironed it).  I would give this a try if you are someone who likes the look of their hair when it is blow dried and/or flat ironed but with what seems much less damage.  I think you could get away with using just this dryer and a little serum (depending on how naturally straight your hair is). I am excited to use this and try to figure out the round brush too.",3/31/2015,5,5.0

Also, the cord on this hair dryer is THICK, as in it is not going to twist and kink up, it is a quality cord that it going to last a LONG time.<br />  All in all, this is a really good hair dryer,  If you are looking for something on the smaller side, something lightweight, that does a great job quickly, this is a good option.<br /><br />ANEMONE Wind Flower Professional Ionic Ceramic Hair Dryer provided by XTAVA.",3/27/2015,5,5.0
RCYAJVWWBQ0CT,52801489,74735317,5,3,N,True,3,Compact Hair Dryer -- Great for Small Space and Most International Travel (5- Stars),"I needed a small hair dryer that would fit in a guest bathroom vanity drawer, and this one not only fit but also works well.  With 1875 Watts, it dries even thick hair quickly when used on the high setting.  The handle folds to make it more compact for storage.<br /><br />This is a basic hair dryer wiith only two speeds, high and low, and one temperature unless you hold down the &#34;cool&#34; button at the top of the handle.  It doesn't have the bells and whistles of more expensive models -- no ceramic coils or diffuser or ionic upgrades.  The handle has a switch to convert from 125 V to 250 V, and you MUST know the voltage of the country you're visiting and manually change the setting or else risk starting a fire.  Remember to change it back when you get home.  A few countries, however, use lower voltages than 125: many Caribbean countries, Japan, Taiwan, and a few South American countries.  Check your destination before you go.  The hair dryer would be completely universal if the power pack handled a range between 100-250 V.  It would also be more useful if it converted automatically the way computer chargers do; however, I've never seen an automatic conversion on a hair dryer.<br /><br />On American current, this is a powerful little hair dryer.  Although most hotels supply hair dryers these days, it works well for those times when either you're not sure you'll find one and when you want to depend on something you know.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann",3/27/2015,5,5.0

The Xtava Rimini 1500W Ionic Hair Dryer really surprised me. I mean, really. First, it is insanely lightweight (I think they say “ultra-lightweight”). There are 3 heat levels and 2 power levels and it comes with two attachments - a diffuser to help eliminate frizz and give more volume and a Concentrator Nozzle for focusing on just one area of your hair to dry that area more rapidly.<br /><br />Now, for how it performed - I have long, wavy, medium-thickness hair (and lots of it) that tends to get frizzy with heat products (so I limit them!) I generally spend 35-40 minutes to get this hair dried with a blow dryer. This, combined with the fact that I was in a bad car accident and it can get really painful when I am styling my hair for so long means I throw mousse in and let it air-dry wavy/curly more often than not. NOT ANYMORE. I LOVE this hair dryer.<br /><br />It took only 20 minutes to completely dry my hair with the diffuser. And, my hair looked FABULOUS. It made my hair so smooth and soft and with no frizz!!! I didn’t need to use extra smoothing lotions or serums like I usually do! The cool shot button helps to “set” the style and it also helps reduce frizz and boost shine (my old one didn’t have one of these!)<br /><br />I cannot recommend this enough! I wish Amazon wasn’t out of stock so I could purchase one for my sister. She’s always replacing hair dryers too!<br /><br />*I received this product in exchange for an unbiased, honest review.*",3/20/2015,5,5.0

I've been pleasantly surprised with this dryer so far! I have very thick hair that usually takes forever to dry, even with a dryer, but this one is nice and light and doesn't make my arm feel like it's going to snap off after holding it for a few minutes. Probably the smartest part of the design is the honeycomb pattern over the back--it's pretty much impossible for my hair to get through it and get stuck in the blades. That makes drying much easier, since I can move the dryer through my hair without worrying about sudden-onset baldness and pain.<br /><br />It's not too loud, and it's definitely quieter than my old dryer. My only minor complaint is that the nozzle (is that what it's called? the duckbill-looking thing that concentrates air) will occasionally fly off in the middle of drying. I'm not sure if that's force from the air, or from moving the dryer around, but it's not quite as secure as it could be.

That's from dripping just out of the shower wet to nearly bone dry in less than half the time. I don't even need to use the highest heat settings so my frizz is much more contained.

Nice color and the design is very sleek and sharp looking. Looks like it's worth a lot more than what it really cost. It comes in a nice box, so it's very suitable for gifting.The description says it's &#34;ultra lightweight&#34; but, for me, it felt like it weighed just as much as any other hairdryer. I like that it has 2 speeds and 3 heat settings. I have very fine hair, so how much heat I use on my hair makes a big difference. The hottest setting does seem to get very hot, so be careful. Also with my fine hair, the higher settings had a tendency to tangle my fine hair, so I had to usually use the medium heat setting, which worked well. The hairdryer itself was not loud and dried my hair quickly. It has a long cord and comes with a concentrator nozzle which really help to reduce frizz. The concentrator nozzle is very easy to remove and put back on when needed. I also like that this hairdryer had a removable filter, it was easy to twist off for cleaning. Overall, it's powerful and does a nice job. I loved the look and it's easy to hold and use. Hoping it will last awhile.

While it did dry my very straight, fine hair quickly, the air flow was so strong that when I put my hair in velcro curlers, the Revlon hair dryer blew the curlers out of my hair!  So I went looking on my beloved Amazon to find a better hair dryer with lots of positive reviews, and ended up ordering this for about the same price I paid for the Revlon one.  This one is great--so much more substantial and quality feeling and noticeably quieter and less shrill sounding than the Revlon.<br /><br />My single complaint is that the toggle switches on the handle that control the air flow and heat settings are a little too easy to accidentally change when drying your hair.

I looked at all of the instructions closely on the box for spelling/grammar mistakes which are common with fakes and found none. I've had about 2 months now and it works well.

This hair dryer comes with a concentrator nozzle but no diffuser. However, a previous diffuser that I owned fit on this just fine. It has a nice long cord too. The only thing is the cord is really thick so it easily knocks stuff down if anything gets in its way. I was very excited to get an opportunity to receive this for testing and inspection purposes. It works very well and dries my hair quickly. I like the more powerful hair blowers because they dry hair much faster than lower wattage dryers do. This one comes in black and looks very stylish. The concentrator works well too but you do need to push hard to get it on the hair dryer. It has three temperatures, hot, warm, and cold (or room temperature but it always feels cold to me.) It also has two speeds, low and high. In addition, it comes with a cool shot button, which gives you a blast of cold air when you push the button. The button is easy to push but it's also black so it blends into the hair dryer. I would have liked it if the cool shot button was a different color.

Noise is per a normal hair dryer.  Heat and air velocity both normal.<br />I went through 3 or 4 of a competing model that would last only 1-2 years and then burn out.  I had just been replacing them because the new dryer would fit into the old wall mount, but decided not to keep shelling out money for an inferior product that did not last.<br />Bought a different competing model but it started making a high pitched sound after 2 days, and did not get hot enough to efficiently dry hair so it was returned.<br />Finally bought this one.  It is not as aesthetically pleasing as competing models, but not quite as ugly as the photo makes it seem.  The dryer is white and gray (wish it were all white), but the gray is a normal gray, not the greenish color that it looks like in the listing.  The wall mount does not install flush to the wall, as others have mentioned, but it is close enough.  I quickly got used to turning it on and off at the wall mount - it not the annoyance I anticipated.  In addition, if you put it in the wall mount while it is on, it automatically turns off, which is kind of convenient.  The best part of this dryer is that you can open the back and clean the fan blades.  I suspect build up of lint on the blades is what eventually caused the other dryers to burn out, and with the other dryers it is not possible to access the blades (at least not easily).  Thus, I expect this dryer to last longer.  There is also a &#34;hidden&#34; setting where you can turn the power up, and I did that when it first arrived.",2/26/2015,4,4.0

When I was given the opportunity to test this Ionic Hair dryer for quality, I was super excited.  There were many things I liked about this blow dryer.<br /><br />1.  I like the shape of the unit.  I was able to hold the dryer by both the shaft and the handle depending on my needs to get the best angle for all my hair.<br /><br />2.  It took about 1/3 less time to dry my hair than with my other blow dryer even though that one has more watts.  I'm not sure if it was due to the less drying time of the fact that this is an ionic dryer that my hair was less frizzy.  It's winter here in Indiana and I generally have to use argon oil on my hair after drying to tame the frizzies.  I did not have to use the oil after using this blow dryer.<br /><br />3.  It's extremely light weight and quieter than my previous dryer.<br /><br />4.  It came with both a diffuser and a concentration nozzle.  I use the diffuser when I want curly hair and the nozzle when I want to go straight and sleek.<br /><br />One thing I did notice is a burning smell the first time I used the unit.  By the time I finished drying my hair though, the smell was gone.  Overall, I am very impressed with the quality and results of this Rimini Xtava.",2/24/2015,5,5.0

After reading all the great reviews raving about the quality of the hair dryer I was somewhat disappointed with it.. It's really powerful, I think even to the extent that it can over-dry and damage certain type of hair if one is not careful, so I'm sure it will dry hair in a shorter period of time, but I still have doubts about it being ceramic and using ionic diffuse technology which makes hair less frizzy and damages less, as I found no mention of it on the hair dryer, the box itself or the paper insert that comes with it.  The hair dryer has somewhat cheap and plastic feeling.. the seams are somewhat poorly made- they scratch your hand when you touch them, and the cold shot button is not a real button per se, it's a piece of plastic hanging there, which I think can get stuck in or broken after some use.. Anyway, it's an OK hair dryer for the price, very powerful, deserving the title Professional, but somewhat cheaply made.. I guess it makes it easier to write raving reviews about a product if you don't pay for it, but for the price you can get a little less powerful but higher quality product",2/24/2015,1,2.0

If you have long hair (or a lot of it), that is something you will surely appreciate.  It also has a very powerful motor so that you can get the job done in no time at all.  If you are like me at all you need to get your hair dry as fast as possible in the morning so you can get on with your day.  And not 'frizzy' dry as many blow dryers are good at accomplishing....but sleek and sexy dry.  The diffuser nozzle of this product makes that possible for me.  It stays on securely while drying my hair and diffuses the air just enough that my hair no longer 'frizzies' up.<br /><br />Some tips on using the diffuser:<br />1: apply your choice of hair products<br />2: allow your hair to dry 75% before using the diffuser (if you are in a rush, use regular blow dryer first without nozzle)<br />3: use clips if you want to add volume at the crown of your head<br />4: if you have time, use the cool setting to dry your hair with the diffuser.  If not enough time, use medium to ensure your hair will not frizz<br /><br />I am truly honored that I was offered the opportunity to review this product at no cost to me.

It dries my long hair in no time and and it doesn't leave my hair frizzy. It is lightweigth and it looks nice. The chrome looking lint trap at the back can be twisted easily and pulled out for cleaning. It looks nice but be very careful because (correct me if I am wrong)  it is made out of a plastic material that seems like it will easily break. I am going to use and keep this hair dryer in the bedroom vanity just incase I drop it, it will fall on the carpet floor. The extra attachment that came with it is also nice. I also have a 1875w Conair infinity that I have been using for years. I love it but I compared the two today and they seem to blow about the same amount of air. If Allure is blowing harder, I cannot really tell. The small button to press cool air is a bit hard to press but truth is, I never use the cool air function anyway so it dont really matter for me. Over all, I will start using this Allure from now on and will give him hubby the Conair one.

It fits perfectly in my hand and it's just the right angle to dry my hair without twisting my hand. Another great thing about this hair is that it really does dry your faster. I am really amazed by how fast it dries your hair and does not leave you with a frizzy head. I can actually use the high speed and not make a mess of my hair. I love the 3 temperatures. Most hairdryers offer heat with the option of the cold button that you have to hold down. This hairdryer not only has the cold press button, but also high heat, low heat, and cool. So you don't have to hold down the cold button because the cool button is cold enough. I like to start out on high heat all over then I divide my hair and use low heat. After drying is complete, I like to set my hair with the cool option. The concentrator nozzle is just the right size. You can also remove the screen on the back of the hairdryer for easy cleaning.

I was intrigued by this dryer because of the Tourmaline, Ceramic and promise to boost shine.  I was also drawn to this particular diffuser because of the long prongs.  I was turned off by the low price because I assumed it would be poor quality.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality.  The dryer is light weight, quieter than my former dryer and much more efficient.  I have long, curly and very thick hair.  This dries my entire head in 15 minutes without burning my hair.

The diffusor is very hard to attach, and even harder to detach.  And this one is my fault - I just assumed that all dryers came with a concentrator, but this one doesn't.

RGCTTRHL89YBI,14492894,646926938,5,0,N,True,0,Happy I took a chance,"I've been using this for about a week now. I previously had a Revlon with retractable cord that still worked, but it was REALLY hot. I have oily hair, so I have to wash it pretty much daily. The heat was killing my long hair. I took a chance on this and I am really glad I did. Initially, I was disappointed, but I am glad I stuck with it.<br /><br />1) Power! It has almost too much power for someone with long hair, my hair was FLYING all over the place (it also tangles easily). I added one of the 3 concentration nozzles and that really helped.<br /><br />2) Heat! Yes, its not super hot -- but heat isn't good either! It does start off rather cool, but it always heats up more about 30-60 seconds into blow drying. With as much power going through it, I don't think you need as much heat to accomplish getting dry hair.<br /><br />3) Buttons! Yes, the buttons are on the side. I think the reason most people complain about button placement is because they are so used to the position of their old hairdryers. It takes some time to get used to a new one. I think people notice the difference a lot at first, but it really will go away and you'll get used to it. It hasn't been an issue for me.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with this blow dryer. I can't say that my hair dries any faster than my previous dryer, but it will be much healthier in the long run and that's something I appreciate more than speed. It definitely does not take a long time by any means though. I am happy I got it!",2/11/2015,5,5.0

Even on cool or medium speed this thing is magnificent! Some of the reviews comment on this dryer being heavy, I'll share a secret...cheap dryers are superlight weight, but in all sincerity, this dryer is not heavy at all, so not sure why some reviews say this. The button placement was an issue when I read the reviews but decided to try it for myself, and what I personally found was, where I place my hand is at the bottom anyways, so it was a non issue for me. It's totally worth trying because everyone is going to hold their dryer in a different spot anyways, and if I didn't purchase this based on what others said about weight and button placement, I would have missed out on the BEST DRYER EVER, and believe me, I have tried them all.

In addition to that, it dries my hair SO fast. I have fairly thick hair, though it's thinned over the years a bit, and it would take me in upwards of 20 minutes to dry my hair with a standard dryer. Using this dryer with a ceramic brush has my hair dry in under 10 minutes every time. The cool shot option is great for just adding a bit of curl around a brush if you're in a hurry, too! My hair tends to get a bit curly as it dries, so I really like the diffuser attachment as well. It works perfectly to smooth out my hair without it poofing out like crazy. I still like to follow up with my straightener because it makes my hair really shine and glow, but the diffuser makes the job much easier.

R1659VFL30JTF7,42747176,197856712,3,1,N,True,1,My blowdryer is DEAD - 4 months later after install.,"Updated Review: 4 months after installing this blowdryer, it died. I was super disappointed given my glowing review below. I have not even contacted Amazon or the manufacturer since it's past the 30 days. The wire below the handle started to heat up a little bit, I smelled smoke. At first thought it was my hair. But, the thing died shortly after. I have another blow dryer. Not sure if I received a lemon or if this is Andis quality. My past blowdryers from other reputable firms would last 7-10 years. 4 months was a HUGE let down  PREVIOUS REVIEW BELOW:  Definite space saver. Quiet. Does the job. I feel the low setting is definitely very low, much lower than my travel blow dryer you can find at any drugstore. However, I like the higher setting. It's nice to wash, blowdry and head out. Makes my mornings much easier to have things in place and organized. This blow dryer comes with two long screws. You have to remove the baby screws on the plate on the back. I then marked the walls where the two holes are. The plastic anchors I did not use, because the frame/holder is super light weight. So is the dryer. It's nice. In addition, the green light makes a nice nightlight in the bathroom. Personally, I wish I could change the color to clear or blue. The photo they provide shows the cord hook is on the right side. There are two other sm/med size screws to hang the cord to either the left or right side. I prefer the right side; however it all depends on where you place it in your bathroom. It's a great product. They thought of almost everything on this dryer. The only two things I would change is to have even a more minimized holder (semi-translucent), optional colored dryers, retractable cord, small dryer, more powerful, cool air option dryer (i.e. fan with a hold button ;-), no cord but a chargeable blow dryer. I think that's about it.",2/1/2015,3,3.0

My previous dryer was packed in a combination of cardboard and plastic which you open once and thats it. You have to throw the packaging and there is no placd to put the dryer back. But this dryer comes in a box and you can put back in the box.<br />The dryer comes with a control nozzle which helps you to focus on certain areas. I have very thick hair and I used to hate taking shower in the morning and drying afterwards. Because it used to take ne really long time to dry them. Now with Rimini dryer it takes me 10 mins and Im ready to go out. Especially in winter I get sick when I go out with wet hair. Rimini dryer has saved my life, time, and energy.<br /> This dryer is great for heavy, thick, long and even short and thin hair. Ut works great and helps you style your hair. Like my older conair dryer it has cold air button too. It has different levels of air pressure. The handle is great to grip on. My older dryer's handle got so greasy after few use. This dryer is awesome.<br />Im 100% satisfied with this dryer. I would highly recommend it. This is the best hair dryer I have ever owned.<br />I received the Rimini dryer in exchange of my honest opinion but it didnt affect my thought.",1/31/2015,5,5.0

It does, however, have a burst-of-cold-air button which is difficult to use.  It's positioned in such a way that you feel it should be pushed UP instead of IN. This button is rectangular and flat, again making it look and feel like it should be pushed up and not in.  Trying to push this button IN is often somewhat difficult (too thin; too highly set) and takes several tries.  If it weren't for that button, which I seem to use a lot, I'd have given it 5 stars instead of 4.  Other than that, I do like this hairdryer.",1/31/2015,5,5.0

The little mini-hair-driers that you find in most hotels these days just won't do the job for me and none of them have a diffuser or will fit a travel-diffuser attachment (which us curly-girls require). But with this hair-drier, I found the answer!!! It has GREAT air-power, 2 heat settings, and dual voltage so you can take it on overseas trips as well. Barely adds any weight to your luggage (so important these days now that airlines charge a hefty fee for non-carry-on luggage or baggage that exceeds their weight limit) and the handle folds up for compact packing. The diffuser attachment works quite well -- maybe not quite as effective as my full-size diffuser with my full-size drier, but pretty darned good.

Doesn't have a 'medium' setting but I don't think that's worth 20 bucks. If you don't like the color blue, well you're outta luck. Guess since it isn't foldable, it may not be good for travel. Whatever, it blow dries my hair at home when I need it to and does a good job at that. Will update review if it spontaneously melts or explodes.    BTW, review is based on the price I paid for it.

(45min cut to 10min!),"Thought I was the only weirdo that struggled to dry her hair w/in 45mins.<br /><br />Recently found out my best friend is the same & she (like me) was convinced there was no way around it.  Writing this review b/c there's probably more of us out there.  And you 100% aren't stuck.<br /><br />I've got long, thin hair - but a lot of it.  It traps moisture & it's naturally wavy, so it always took me 30-45mins to tame it dry.  Most of the time, a solid 45mins.  Result was hit or miss.  Since I have to wash my hair every other day, breaking point comes when you don't want to wash your hair b/c you don't want to deal with the drying time & tired arms (...and I'm strong).<br /><br />Bought this on a whim during a Gilt Group sale, when my generic (probably Conair) dryer was on the out.<br /><br />Now I dry my hair in 10-15mins.  Usually, a bankable 10mins.  On a bad hair day, 15mins.<br /><br />No, seriously.<br /><br />On top of that pile of awesome, it's very light & evenly weighted.  Buttons are intuitive & don't get accidently knocked on/off while you use it.  Results are always the same.  Doesn't damage my hair w. heat (probably b/c it takes so little time).  And it's small enough that it's an easy travel companion.<br /><br />Don't get scared off by this dryer's price - it's a life saver.  And game changer.  Delay getting this if you want to waste your time.<br /><br />For the Holy Trifecta: this hairdryer, a boar bristle roller brush, & Shu Uemura White Tea Polishing Milk.<br /><br />This dryer & a boar bristle brush easily tames my hair w. little effort & leaves it looking silky smooth.  Every time.  (Note: choose a brush that has both natural boar bristles & taller plastic bristles w. the knob-like, non-scratchy tip - needs a decent amount of boar bristles, but few enough to let air through easily. It doesn't have to be expensive, just needs to fit those parameters.)  For doubled ease, get Shu's White Tea Polishing Milk.  A little goes a long way.  You'll be a happyaddict.  Rub some in your hands & pat it from middle of your hair to the ends, but particularly the ends to give them a little tangle protection.  It helps smooth my hair even faster & it lets my hair better tackle humidity - friends have commented that I look normal when they feel they don't.  PS - The brush & Shu isn't a hack - the dryer is.  The 3 together is trifecta.<br /><br />I was ecstatic to find this - I'd always struggled just to tame my stubborn hair.  Now I actually feel in control of it.  Just bought a replacement for my 3/4yr old original & also bought one for my mom as an xmas present. My friend's now a convert & begging for the name of my dryer.<br /><br />You won't regret.",1/26/2015,5,5.0

I hope that they are able to get a foothold in this industry and keep on making such great items!<br /><br />The Rimini blow dryer for starters, is a gorgeous hair dryer.  We desperately needed a new hair dryer because ours is ready to die anytime now.  This definitely is a step up from the cheapo dryer we had purchased.<br /><br />It drys our hair so quickly.  Even my daughter who has much thicker and coarse hair than myself it doesn't take much time at all until her hair is completely dry.  There are two speed settings, low and high as well as three heat settings plus the Cold Shot button.  I find that I use the medium heat and the high speed settings the most.<br /><br />I also love that it has a little hook on it so that you can easily hang it on a nail for easy access in your bathroom.  The cord is long enough to be able to style your hair just about anywhere you need it.  It's not like REAL quiet, but it's not as loud as some hairdryers.  It really is one of the best dryer's I've used and it's definitely the best hair dryer that I've ever personally owned!!  I'm so impressed by the quality of Xtava and their products!<br /><br />**  Review Product Received",1/24/2015,5,5.0

I love how compact it is (smaller than regular sized dryers), it is almost like a travel type of dryer. I find it very easy to use and that it gives me such the softest appearance with hair.

My hair is on the normal side, not too thick and not too thin. It is also fairly straight.<br /><br /> I feel that this hair dryer without the diffuser (black top) creates such a satin feel to the hair and that with the diffuser on my hair gets so shiny! So what I do is do about 2-5 min without the black top diffuser and 3 minutes with it on. The cool thing about this hair dryer is that it comes with 2 diffusers (one wide and one thin), it helps cater to your hair and what you want done to it.

My hair is very thick and frizzy/curly (slightly past my shoulders).  I used to have my hair professionally done (roller-set and blown out) every week when I lived close to my favorite hair salon.  When my husband and I moved, I couldn't find a salon that was close enough for weekly appointments, and it was just getting expensive.  I've had other standing hair bonnet dryers, but this is the kind I see most at professional hair salons, and for a reason.  It's fairly quiet (except for the ticking sound from the timer).  It goes up to 75 degrees Celsius, which is about 167 degrees Fahrenheit (very hot), but there is a dial that lets you adjust the temperature all the way down to cool temps.  I usually keep mine at 65 degrees Celsius (about 150 F).  There is another dial where you set the time and it goes up to a full hour, which is what I need.  I don't have to worry about keeping track of time as the dryer turns off automatically with the time you set.  I just roller-set my hair, set the timer, and read or nap until the dryer stops.  I love it!  Caveat: While assembly is easy, it was not so smooth to do.  My husband had to re-order replacement parts because they did not fit together properly the first time.  Still worth it, if you have the space to store it!",1/17/2015,5,5.0

It has all the features:  More heat, at 1875 watts  ---  Salon quality motor - up to 40% more air flow and three times the service life  ---  Ceramic pearl technology (Ceramics for even heating, and infused with crushed pearls which transfer to hair)  ---  Ionic generator to bathe hair with positive ions  ---  Concentrator and diffuser blower attachments  ---  Three heat settings, two fan speeds, and a cool shot feature.<br /><br />I don't use hair dryers.  My wife does, and when she broke her old Remington T/Studio, she would have nothing but another T/Studio as a replacement.  By the way, this dryer has a 4 year warranty, so keep your receipt.  (In our case, the dryer was about 2 years old but we no longer had the receipt, and the breakage was due to her dropping it and the fan speed switch physically broke . . . so I appropriated the old dryer, wired the fan speed to permanent high and the old hair dryer now resides in my workbench to serve as my hot air gun when I need one).<br /><br />Not cheap, but a very high end dryer and worth the price for us.

It did not get super hot (which was good for the window kit), though I have no idea if that's good or bad from a hair drying perspective. I could have bought a cheaper hair dryer, but I chose this one because it is tourmaline ceramic, ionic, has several attachments, and multiple settings including a cool breeze setting -- all with the idea that after I was done using it on the window kit, I could provide it to female guests. This turned out to be a good idea, since my housemate's younger sister is currently visiting, and she was happy that I had a hair dryer for her to use. I asked for her opinion, and she says, &#34;It's great.&#34; Pressed for more details, she says, &#34;I like that it has a lot of different settings.&#34; As it turns out, this is in fact the first hair dryer she has ever used.

RW8F1TYMJW5RV,4858065,415529274,5,70,N,True,71,Amazing Performance in a Very Small Package,"Wow.  This thing is great!<br /><br />No, it's not as powerful or capable as a &#34;full-sized&#34; dryer.  But, what do you expect from something that literally fits in the palm of your hand?  I, myself, expect a lot less than this dryer delivers.<br /><br />Unlike a lot of travel hair dryers, this one locates the fan at the back of the barrel and has some barrel length to it.  This lines the airflow up giving a useful stream of air instead of the every-which-way mess of air that most travel dryers produce.  It's not as directional as a full-sized dryer with a longer barrel, but it's better than most travel dryers.<br /><br />One reviewer reported that the controls are not labeled.  This is not true on the dryer I received.  The Low/Off/High switch and the voltage selector are clearly marked.<br /><br />Several reviewers have complained of it making a very high-pitched motor noise, getting very hot, smelling bad, and then dying.  The unit is shipped set for 125V (USA) power.  While it is true that many modern electronic devices have &#34;auto-ranging&#34; or &#34;universal&#34; AC inputs and work properly on any line voltage anywhere, this little hairdryer isn't one of them.  If you plug this dryer into 250V (European) power without manually changing the voltage selector switch to the 250V setting, the dryer will quickly fail exactly as described.  And that will be your fault, misuse, and not cause for a poor review.<br /><br />Mine has worked fine.  It drys my hair almost as fast as my &#34;professional&#34; dryer at home.  Its size, weight, and performance make this an easy choice for travel.",1/6/2015,5,5.0

Actually worth the money!,"I've always been skeptical about new, amazing, breakthrough technology in beauty products.  I certainly believe there are different levels of quality and also that one product may perform better or worse on different people.  So I was hoping this dryer would make a difference, while being prepared for less than spectactular results.  So drum roll please...I personally thought my hair looked silkier, shinier and it did dry noticeably faster, but the shocker was that other people really noticed the difference!<br />My adult daughters to whom I am often apparently invisible, both asked me individually and on seperate occassions if I had just had my hair done, and what had I done differently etc.  Ironically, the evening that I had in fact come straight from the salon (and prior to using this product) warranted no notice.  I've had others compliment my hair as well.  I'm giving more weight to those who see me all the time and tend not to use flattery to judge that there was a very noticable difference.<br />  The other thing worth mentioning is that in my youth my hair was one of my best assests in terms of appearance.  For the past 10 years or so, its become a definite liability.  I joke that it's a fire hazard and I'm not allowed near open flame as it is so dry and so covered in product that its quite flammable.  I put a fair bit of effort into getting it to be healthier and less frizzy and I've actually had people ask me if I've ever tried a really good conditioner or anti-frizz product.  After what I hope is a chilling gaze I let them know I do believe I have tried nearly all conditioners/styling products. So it is a rare thing indeed for me to rave about a hair product or in this case hair dryer and I must give it a rave review!<br />  If you possess beautiful, soft, smooth heathly hair this may not be worth the money,  but if like me you color frequently and have those weird coarse alien hairs springing up randomly then I would say go for it!",1/6/2015,5,5.0

Also the pole is spring loaded which makes it easier to adjust up but harder-er to adjust down but you don't have to be super strong to do it.

First, this is NOT a particularly quiet hair dryer. Having been used to really quiet dryers in Europe, where the EU sets noise standards on such appliances, I have constantly been frustrated by the obnoxious noise levels of hair dryers here in the U.S. So, as American blow dryers go, this one is pretty good, especially on the SET setting, but it's certainly NOT exceptionally quiet. Nor is it lighter in weight than the dryer I currently have. So buy it for the functionality, but not for the sound level or the weight. However, one big advantage is that this dryer has a normal size plug, rather than the ginormous ones with the pop-out breaker that are common on other products sold in the U.S. Our bathroom outlets already have the pop-out breakers so we don't need them on appliances used in the bathroom, so not having to accommodate the giant plug is a big plus.",12/29/2014,4,4.0

I have fine hair, not the thick curly that drives most shoppers toward a certain brand. This one works great for my fine hair, and a plus is that I have not had static during the drying process like with the cheaper hairdryers. There are two settings for ionic, and I don't know what the other setting is supposed to do, but the other setting does introduce static, so I use one ionic setting at all times. The main characteristic I searched for was the sound volume and pitch. Someone wrote a review that said they could actually hear the doorbell ring while using this hairdryer, and that convinced me to purchase this model. It is actually true - the pitch is not really a pitch, but rather a low sound that will save my eardrums. My husband can actually sleep when I blow dry, where he could not before.

I thought it was strange that it didn't get hot even on the highest heat setting...... it was still cool enough after several seconds that I could aim it directly at my face comfortably.  On the second try, it got hot for about 5 seconds.... and then went cool again.  Third try - no heat.  I am glad I kept the box so I can send it back for my replacement.    So I am exchanging this for the same design in hopes that the replacement will have a working heating element.  I still rated it as a moderate success because the high and low settings for air, and the three temperature settings are a wonderful design.  It blows really hard, which is what I like.  I also am hoping the diffuser will allow me to maximize the wave in my hair for those days when I don't want to straighten it (or when it's humid outside).  It's ilghtweight and has a nice feel to the grip.  I hope the replacement will up the rating to a full 5 stars!    UPDATE: I received my replacement (what a simple process, too... kudos for easy returns!), and this hairdryer is perfect for me.  Now that the heating element is working, I am able to see that the heat settings are just what I want, cool is cool, medium is my favorite for regular use, and hot is good and hot but not scorching (I might use this on the low blower setting to set a curl when my hair is in velcro rollers).

I've had the expensive one for about 3 years or more, no issues.  The good thing about this Revlon (in addition to the price) is that it is much lighter weight.  So, I'll keep using it until it breaks.  One other thing to note, the cool burst button is really easy to accidentally trigger when you're drying your hair.

This will get the job done. You should never use above 1800W anyhow. Don't forget to use cool burst all over head after drying as well. MIRACLE worker.<br /><br />My hair usually takes 40 minutes plus With no brushing, which makes it take way longer.<br />My previous dryer had way more W and blew harder.<br />This dryer takes my hair 10-15 minutes (maybe) with brushing it out.<br />My hair is soft and semi sleek.<br /><br />My hair is extra coarse, dry, frizzy and THICK.

But my wife has very thick long hair and uses a blow dryer every time she washes her hair. I've kept a close eye on her hair since she started using this dryer and I can't detect any difference either. So I asked her directly, would you pay $130 for this? No, she wouldn't. She said that it's not much different than her $40 dryer.<br /><br />I like the fact that there are two independent controls: temp and air speed. That's nice. I also like the fact that you can override the heat and blast cold air on demand. That's a great touch.<br /><br />But as far as the moisturizing and conditioning aspects, I can't detect them at all.

The dryer does have side buttons, which for many people was an issue, but the dryer I had prior had the same feature and it doesn't get in my way now as it didn't then. The hair dryer is light/medium weight. The swivel cord hasn't been an issue for me either.

It looks sleek and, despite the size, doesn't feel overly heavy. The weight is well balanced. The cold blast feature works as expected. The issues I had was with the sliding button controls which can be a little stiff. Also, I have straight, moderately thick hair and the 'conditioning' effect sometimes flatten my hair. Hair can feel too soft that there's not enough 'lift' and bounce. This is great when hair is brittle and frizzy. Not so great on humid days. Curly hair may not have this issue.

This one came up with the most reviews in this price range. I know I shouldn't but I wash and dry my hair every day. I needed something reliable but under $30.<br /><br />The first thing that bothered me was that I received an obvious return which doesn't bode well. I've tried this for a couple days so the jury's still out but right away here's what I like and don't like about it:<br /><br />PROS<br />-very quiet<br />-lightweight<br />-useful attachments<br />-multiple speed options<br />-cool shot<br />-ability to clean filter<br /><br />CONS<br />-nozzle is longer<br />-matte finish makes it slippery to hold<br />-cool shot button is much shorter than older Conair<br />-easy to accidentally press/hold cool shot when you don't want it<br />-speed/heat button sliders very cheaply made<br />-filter is hinged and doesn't open all the way<br /><br />For price and value, okay buy. If you have short arms like I do, the longer barrel makes for an awkward morning ritual. Also, since it's slippery to hold, you have to learn how to hold it differently which can be problem, if like me, you have arthritis issues. With the old Conair, I could lazily hold it however I want. I could rest my thumb below the cool shot button since it protruded at least 1/2&#34; and you really had to push it down to use it. The cool shot on this one is flimsy and depresses quite easily. I'm also worried about the settings buttons. It does not seem very secure and/or there is only a small attachment in the middle. In other words, as you slide them, the top and bottom of the buttons are not attached in any way to the unit. They actually stick out a little bit (are not completely flushed against the handle). Whether this will be a problem should they come off remains to be seen.<br /><br />Overall a mixed bag but it was priced fairly cheap.

The Conair has only two setting (high and low) and did not come with any accessories.  So going from the Conair to the Panasonic Nanoe was like upgrading from a basic to a state-of -the-art hair dryer.<br /><br />The Panasonic Nanoe comes with a quick-dry nozzle, a set nozzle and a diffuser. It boasts 3 temperatures settings--hot, warm and cool, and a choice of strong (high) or gentle (low) airflow.  What makes this hair dryer special is that it produces nanoe or invisible water particles that cling to your hair as you dry it.<br />I have thick hair that reaches to my shoulders and when I used the Panasonic, I had the impression that strands of hair were separated. It boosted my hair's natural volume and gave it more movement. And my hair felt softer too after I used the Panasonic with the quick-dry nozzle and the diffuser.  My sister who has long fine hair also agreed that this dryer seemed to give her hair more volume too.<br /><br />Since I've been handling a mini dryer for years, it took a bit of time to get used to the full-sized Panasonic. At first it felt heavy, especially when I attached the diffuser to it, and therefore was somewhat awkward to manage.  However, I'm getting used to its weight and size and therefore doing a better job at styling my hair with it.  The Panasonic Nanoe does emit a smell, but according to the operating instructions booklet, it is normal and harmless.<br /><br />I'm glad I got this hair dryer. I like having the different temperature settings, especially the cool one because I want to avoid heat damage.  With my old dryer, I didn't have any other choice but hot.  After using an attachment with the hot setting, it may be warm to the touch so handle with care if you need to switch nozzles.  This is a great hair dryer. I don't quite understand the fine details behind the Nanoe technology, but these invisible particles certainly make my hair look good.",11/30/2014,5,5.0

After looking through reviews I decided to purchase this one over some cheaper models or buying the same Vidal Sassoon model I've owned for many years.<br />My first impression was that I was shocked by how heavy it was, because it's ceramic. It can be sort of awkward to use before you get used to it. Secondly, the difference between the &#34;warm&#34; to the &#34;hot&#34; setting is pretty big. The &#34;warm&#34; on mine has barely more heat than the &#34;cool&#34; setting and the &#34;hot&#34; setting is too hot to use for more than a minute or two. The &#34;hot&#34; also makes my hair super frizzy, but that's fixed by blasting it on the &#34;cool&#34; setting after the heat. But I do worry that it damages my hair. I would use the &#34;warm&#34; setting if it didn't take so long.<br />This hair dryer is kept at my boyfriend's and I only use it to dry the roots of my hair with the diffuser to give them lift, so it doesn't see much use.

I have long hair and constantly fight with the air intake valve on my other hair dryers as they suck up my hair and it gets tangled up inside!  The Rimini by XTAVA  has mesh like metal over the air intake valve and cannot suck my hair into it. Secondly, it is powerful which is probably why it says professional in the name and oh SO quiet compared to all the other hair dryers I have used.  Third, it is light and the handle makes it so easy to use and to reach the different control buttons while you are still drying.  Love that it has a cold shot button to help &#34;set&#34; my hair.  It comes with a control nozzle that fits very well and is easy to get off and on to precisely aim the air right where you want it.<br />All in all I will tell you this is the best hair dryer that I have ever owned and it is aesthetically pretty too!  I won't get into all the specs because you can read them above but it does have 3 heat settings and yes, I use them all during one drying and it has 2 speed settings plus the cold shot button.

RGAJI9YESY5S8,52992904,768062995,3,46,Y,False,56,Nanoe Yes; Plastic No,"I tested this hair dryer against two older models we have. One was a Conair with ceramics in the wind tunnel and ionizer. The other was an older BayBliss hair dryer, also with ceramics but no advertized ionizing properties. I didn't use a towel at all for the tests because I figured, if it works as advertized, the Panasonic should dry out my skin less well too. It seems to work.<br /><br />All three are very good hair dryers. I think the Panasonic did the best job of not fizzing up my hair and leaving it feeling very nice. HOWEVER, it stinks! It smelled like I was blowing melted plastic all around the room. That is not the case when I use either the Conair or the BayBliss. Additionally, while both the others are premium models, neither cost more than $50.<br /><br />I'm going to let the Panasonic air out for a month or so outdoors in the sun. Maybe some of the plastic stink will outgas and it will be a great hair dryer. Many people aren't as sensitive as I am to these plastic odors. If you love that new car smell, especially the smell of mostly plastic interiors after they have baked in the sun with the windows up, you'll love the smell of the Panasonic. I can't stand the smell of Fabreze or Bounce but maybe you think they're wonderful. If so, you'll think this dryer is to die for.<br /><br />I think they have the makings of a very good product. That nanoe technology seems to work. However, I'm concerned that each of those tiny little water droplets is surrounded by plastic particles, making it all the easier to find its way to my lungs. Hopefully, airing out will do the trick but I would still recommend a redesign to keep the hot air away from plastic parts.<br /><br />Addendum: I initially gave the product 5 stars but upon reflection I have decided there is no excuse for putting out a product that runs hot air directly past plastic when companies have been making hair dryers with metal or ceramic coated nozzles for years. Yes, recycling water vapor is a great idea, but don't forget to use the best of older technology as well. Plus a hair dryer this expensive should have a dual voltage switch.<br /><br />Update: Because of the smell, I gave the hair dryer away.... to my barber. He uses it frequently and likes it.

It is not the same as all the others.  I have straight, thick hair and have a hard time getting volume due to the weight of my hair making it lay flat.  I do blow dry my hair to give it some volume but it usually doesn't last long.  But with the Panasonic hair dryer, I get so much volume! It is amazing!  I don't know if it is due to the moisture being put back into the hair but my hair looks great and others have told me the same thing.  My hair also seems to hold the volume almost all day long which is unusual for my hair.<br /><br />At first the dryer took a little bit of getting used to as it is a bit bulky, but it is light weight.

It's so cute and improbable, like a Barbie-doll toy hairdryer in very pink plastic, just like its picture online in its box, complete with miniature pink plastic diffuser & concentrator.

The quality is self-evident when you open the package and pull out this professional sized hairdryer.  Although it looks like it would weigh a lot, it is surprisingly light and easy to handle. The controls are simple on the handle, with one side of the switch for temperature, cool, warm, and hot.  The other switch is for high or low air flow, yielding 6 possible combinations.  The Nanoe comes with three nozzles, which slip onto the front of the dryer.  The Set Nozzle for precise styling, the Quick-dry nozzle for drying hair quickly and the Diffuser for creating full bodied hair with volume and styling.  The is also a Cool Shot button on the handle to temporarily turn of the heat, to allow time to style.  The dryer comes with a heavy duty 9 foot cord with a safety overheating/reset plug.<br /><br />The Panasonic has Nanoe technology, which takes moisture from the air and your hair and puts moisture rich particles, small enough to penetrate your hair shafts.  That's quite a mouthful.  What it did for my hair was make it soft and silky, and I can see nuances in the color which I didn't notice before.  The blonde is blonder, the brown is richer.  My hair dried quickly and quietly, none of the loud buzzing in my ear.  As I run my fingers through my hair, there is none of that dry, frizzy, overblown feeling with my lower priced dryers.<br /><br />For results like this, you need to make an appointment at a salon.

I had an old Conair hair dryer since early 2000's and it finally took a dive. What I loved about my old dryer was how lightweight and powerful it was. I searched on Amazon for the same and/or similar style and came across this. The Conair 1875 Watt Tourmaline Ceramic hair dryer is as good or better than the older version, which had the same wattage. It is lightweight, powerful, and so comfortable to use. The switches were an important part for me. I love the slide switches because you can grab it by the handle and not accidentally turn it off while you're using it. I have very long and thick hair and this gets the job done! If you're the type of person who doesn't want sore arms when drying your hair, this is perfect for you!",11/17/2014,5,5.0

R1JK2G2LDBI4LL,49095707,732252283,5,0,N,True,0,Highly recommended for fine hair - will leave hair feeling soft!,"I am very surprised to be writing a raving review about a hair dryer.  I never really gave much thought to my hair dryer and the potential damage it could do to my hair.  My last dryer (it was either a Clairol or Revlon-I threw it out after it starting throwing sparks) left my hair extremely dry after approximately two years' use.  I kept switching shampoos and conditioners, thinking that my hair was just changing and I needed to find a new product.  Turns out all I had to do was buy a new hair dryer!  Before purchasing this dryer, I read a few online articles that suggested a lower wattage dryer for fine hair.  That is basically how I ended up with this dryer-it was the lowest wattage dryer (besides a travel dryer) for a reasonable price.  I have only been using it for a few weeks now and the difference in the feel of my hair has been unbelievable - extremely soft!  In addition, the dryer is surprisingly quiet and dries my full head of hair in less time than my prior dryer.  Overall, I recommend this product.",11/7/2014,2,3.0

It probably makes a better &#34;travel&#34; dryer than anything.  It doesn't allow you to adjust the temp (cool, warm, hot), but it does have a cold shot button.  You can only choose High or Low speeds.  I totally missed those details in the online description that before my purchase.  I did watch the video and it is what sold me, but the video makes this dryer look more powerful than it really is.  Perhaps if you don't have thick hair like me it would perform more to my liking.<br /><br />In my opinion, I don't think it is even close to salon performance.  It says it uses ion technology, but my last Conair that was labeled ionic worked so much better and dried my hair faster with hardly any frizz.

I used to go to a beaty salon to have my hair dry. It took usually 45-50 minutes for my stylist to dry my hair, which is just not long, thick and wavy: I have a lot of it, too (my stylist used to joke saying I had to heads in one, but sometimes another stylist would come to give her a hand... imagine to people pulling at your hair at the same time... it felt as if they were trying to split my head in two, sometimes!). My stylist is great, and became my great friend, but no matter how well she treated my hair, and how many conditioners, etc. I used, my hair got scorched enough that a some of it was always breaking in half, the natural waviness lost in an ugly way (the half of the hair closest to the roots, the other half wavy still... When I had my hair wet, it looked weird).<br /><br />One day I decided to get myself a blowdryer, and got the FHI 2000. Which turned out to be great, and while drying my hair with difficulty at first, because of my lack of practice, I managed. Seating in front of a mirror, I would bravely spent 1 hour drying my hair. It was worth it! My hair changed a lot, and the huge amounts of money I used to spend at the beaty salon were no longer necessary. Once I encountered my former stylist in the supermarket, and she thought I was visiting another beauty salon, she didn't believe me when I told her it was me (she didnt tell me, but from her face I could tell she didnt believe me).<br /><br />After a bit more than 3 years, my FHi dryer fell to the floor and the little fan inside broke. I strongly advise you not to attempt repair with any other generic piece of whatever that is not original or not from the FHI repair service (if they have any, I dont know, because I live in the Caribbean). I did that, and regretted it a lot, since the repaired dryer damaged my hair. I had to condition it lots and lots afterwards, but I have to wait for my hair to outgrow the damage (grrr!).<br /><br />Then I decided to get myself a nice, professional hair drier, and checked the Babyliss Pro with all the great feedback. After using it and learning to manage it (because it is so fast!), I cannot stop myself from congratulating me for my accurate decision! My sister tried it (she has wavy and think hair too), and immediately ordered one for her. I dry my daughter's and mother's hair too. The drying time is much less now, and the hair is great! I notice that while I still have damaged hair from the repaired old dryier, the half hair closer to the roots which is not damaged has remained healthy, keeping its natural waviness for when I decide to let it dry alone.<br /><br />The Babyliss Pro is powerful, fast, and easy to manage. It is a bit smaller in size than the other dryer I had, which is just fine for me. I feel that since the blower is so fast, I can avoid the heat fto touch my hair for so long, thus making a more healthier drying experience for my hair everytime.

However, this blow dries my hair pretty fast. So, it does what's required of it!    I took one star off because it does seem louder than your average hair dryer. If you live in a house, that's probably not a big deal; but if your apt has thin walls... you might not want to blow dry your hair in the middle of the night.    I really like the fact that the cord is retractable. Word of caution: hang on to the plug when you hit the retraction button because it will fly all over the place. And if you're not careful, this can probably hit you in the face because it retracts very fast.    Lastly, a couple reviews have mentioned that this Conair 1875 is heavier than most hair dryers.

It was fine so I moved it up to high/warm and continued. I used it for a minute before I heard crackling sounds from inside and looked in, the coils inside were turning red hot so I turned it off. About a minute later I turned it back on low to see if it was a fluke, the dryer started to hum quietly (not at the speed/sound it was just at when working properly) and then caught on fire! Smoke coming out of both ends, inside red hot and small flames. Needless to say it is unusable and I will be returning for a refund. I had it less than 24 hours and literally one use and it is gone.

But when I tried to switch it to 250 volts before traveling,  I found it is poorly designed, poorly documented, and dangerous.<br /><br />First, the documentation does not make it clear that you MUST switch it manually from 125 to 250 volts.  From the other reviews I can see that many people will assume it will switch automatically (like most laptops and cell phone chargers).  It will not.  These other users apparently did not flip this switch and reported that it gets hot and noisy when they use it at 250 volts. This is expected and is extremely dangerous.<br /><br />The switch is horrible.  It has no markings to point to the 125 or 250 volt setting, so I had to guess.  Only by trial and error (and the fact that it was supposed to be initially set to 125 volts), did I figure out which was which.<br /><br />I needed to use a screwdriver to turn the switch because, unlike most devices, a coin will not fit in the slot.  So unless I would have brought my toolbox with me on my trip, I could not switch it (even if I was aware that you need to do so).<br /><br />After turning the switch back and forth a couple of times it broke.<br /><br />I am a mechanical engineer and I decided to take it apart to see if the design really is as bad as it appears.  It is.  Switching the badly documented, badly designed switch is really necessary to change the circuit from 125 to 250 volts and avoid dangerous overvoltage and overheating.",9/28/2014,2,2.0

The huge disappointment in this dryer is that this is my second one, and in a year it broke the one before that same deal, lasted just under 2 years.  A $150 dryer should last longer than that.

I always thought air drying was best for the health of my hair but lately my hair has gotten so gross and messy and frizzy that I almost considered giving myself a hair cut and just chopping off everything off a few times. I did start using a cleanser once a week and that helped somewhat but my hair was still just horrible. So instead of doing something drastic I decided to give blow drying a chance. I bought the Babyliss 3 in 1 diffuser with it so I've only ever used the two together. Before I get into the results, my first two thoughts when opening the box was that 1. The black is a beautiful deep matte color and the pink is a lot nicer on the product then in the picture and 2. It's a lot lighter than I expected. Everybody complained about how heavy it was. Again, I've never owned a hair dryer so maybe they're normally a lot lighter then this one. But from me, no complaints!<br /><br />And to the results... My hair is absolutely amazing now. Sometimes I'll just look at my hair in the mirror or even when a perfect curl falls on my shoulder and I'm just so happy. It's like it was styled and curled for hours to get it to look like that. It takes about 20 minutes to dry it completely and style it which sure beats the 4 hours it takes to air dry it. I put in some before products, lots of mousse and some gel and get to scrunching and by the end my hair is so full of volume and curls! And the best part is that my hair is still perfect for the next two days. Sometimes I'll rewet my hair and diffuse it for about 5 minutes to add more curl to it but then I'm good to go!<br /><br />I've never used the blow dryer to straighten my hair yet but if and when I do I'll review that. But for now I'm loving my curls!!",9/27/2014,5,5.0

I don't see why this dryer would be any worse than others.<br /><br />It IS stronger than my old dryer but I had to try them both back to back to convince myself, the difference is not dramatic.

I've never had a cool temp before so I tried it, who knows, maybe that is why my hair feels especially nice.<br /><br />It's definitely heavier than the average cheap blow dryer but it did seem that my hair dried quicker so I think it's an OK trade-off. Also my old dryer's motor sounds pretty cheap and sick after the hum of this one, but I don't find much difference in loudness or tone.<br /><br />I like the rocker controls. The whole reason I bought a new dryer is that my really old dryer died, I had a spare hanging around the house that I started to use, but it has slider controls and I found it impossible to change settings without stopping and looking and even then it was hard to move the sliders.

It IS heavy and big, but I'm ok with it, and I'm tiny.  I don't see how a dryer can be not heavy if it has good vibration damping and noise muffling, which this does.  I love the low noise level, as it is right by my ear, I've had enough of the loud flimsy light dryers in the past.  The only annoying thing is the buttons on the handle.  I have to be very careful when I move it around my head, it's easy to touch the buttons and change the settings unintentionally.  Also the head is LONG; I have long hair too, and I'm a tiny person.  Sometimes I grasp the blower part like pros do in salons, thank goodness for its low vibration.  Just that the beautiful silk finish gets oily from my hand that way.

REKOCDKRELLWP,43966088,768062995,5,36,N,False,42,Great Hair Dryer!  Well Worth the Money!!!,"I have long hair, that is about half way down my back.  I've never been a huge fan of blow dryers and used to just let my hair air dry.  Lately my hair is wavier than it used to be if I air dry it, so it doesn't look as nice, and I've started blowing it dry most times I wash it.  Previously, I've only purchased a couple of hair dryers, and I don't think I spent much money on them.  I have been dealing with some flyaways lately too so when my previous blow dryer quit on me, I did a little research before buying a new one.  I never anticipated spending this much money on a blow dryer.  I mean, aren't they all the same?  I soon learned that the answer is NO.<br /><br />This is still a fairly new product, so there were not a lot of reviews to go by.  I did research on what to look for in a hair dryer.  It was pretty easy to decide that negative ions are a good thing when buying a hair dryer.  Tourmaline? Ceramic? Well, ok, but what about nanoe?  It seems that Panasonic is the only one using this technology right now.  Infuses 1000x more moisture into hair than typical ion hair dryers?  I was definitely skeptical when I read that.<br /><br />I knew that I definitely wanted separate controls for speed and heat, and the Panasonic EH-NA65-K has that.  I was also hoping to find a hair dryer that came with a couple of attachments.  The nozzle for my last hair dryer would come off sometime when I was using the hair dryer because it just slipped over the end of the dryer.  The Panasonic comes with 3 different attachments that snap into place and can be turned to whatever orientation you are looking for.  They are nice attachments!<br /><br />As I said before, there were only a few reviews out there, but what was there was nothing but great reviews.  What the heck, I decided to give it a try and I must say that I'm very pleased.  This hair dryer is quite a bit quieter than my previous one.  I also really noticed how much I am used to the quietness of this the last time I got a hair cut and the salon used a regular dryer to dry my hair.  It was way louder.  This also dries my hair much quicker, which is really nice.  With the amount of hair I have, it takes a while to dry.  Most of the time I am using the quick dry nozzle.  I also found that I didn't need to brush my hair while using this hair dryer.  I just dry it free style and my hair looks good and straight when I'm done.  As for the flyaways, it didn't completely solve that problem, but it does seem to make that better too.<br /><br />After using this hair dryer the first time, I thought my hair looked a little darker than normal, and figured that my mind must just be playing tricks on me since I know this is supposed to infuse moisture in my hair.  The next day, one of my coworkers asked me if I did something different to my hair.  I asked why they asked and they said my hair looked a little different color than normal.  I have natural red hair and have never dyed my hair before.  I couldn't believe it!  I didn't tell anyone that i was getting a new hair dryer.  That told me that what I noticed must have been true.<br /><br />To summarize, I am very happy with my new hair dryer.  It hurt to spend this much money at first, but now I think it was well worth the cost.  Now I just wish that Panasonic would come out with a travel size nanoe hair dryer.  This hair dryer is a little larger than a regular one, due to the nanoe port on the top.  Between that and just the weight of it being a full size hair dryer, I don't really want to take it with me when I travel.  I travel for business about once a month a really miss this hair dryer when I'm gone.<br /><br />Panasonic, please make a Travel Nanoe Hair Dryer!",9/19/2014,5,5.0

I recommend dryers like this though for households where it is only being used once or twice daily, because the engines aren't super powerful for professional use and the retractable cord does have a shelf life. Of course I've had my dryer for months now and it's all working great still, but if you have daughters or someone sharing it and they aren't careful when using it, or just using it too much, it will break eventually. Also- great tip for using the retractable cord- always pull the cord down at a casual pace, don't just yank it. Also, when pressing the button for it to go back in, what I do is grab the plugin and hold it really close to wear the retractable entry is and then hold down the button.

R1BGF8OU3LXMDC,37590519,983445543,5,23,N,True,23,Best Wall Mounted Unit on the Market,"Right after I first encountered one of these units over 15 years ago in a California motel, I have bought and installed them in all three of our bathrooms.  I have used competitive designs in other motels, but find that this one is still the best, and is reasonably durable.  Based on my experience, I would guess that a unit is good for about 3,000 uses, at a cost therefore of about 1 cent per use (not counting the cost of electricity).  In addition to high  and low fan settings, It also has two power (heat) settings; 1200 Watts and 1500 Watts; I prefer the higher one. The unit is shipped with the 1200 Watt setting.  In order to set it to 1500 Watts, you must pry off the air intake cover to get to the hidden switch.  You can also hide almost any length of excess power cord in the raceway on the back of the unit.  You may need to experiment some and use some sharp U-turns to get the length just right for your situation. You should also pry off the air intake cover and vacuum out the air intake grill at least once each month to maintain good air flow, and to avoid tripping the overheat thermal protector. I use the little lever on a fingernail clipper as a pry rod.  It fits just right into the pry notch. I too liked the smaller and utilitarian design of the older model, but understand that most buyers prefer the ergonomic look of the new unit.  When you stored the older unit into a mechanical clip, it gave you an audible click to let you know that it was firmly in; the newer model uses a magnetic mount. You don't have to jam it in, but you do need to make sure the magnet has taken hold before you pull away your hand.",8/28/2014,5,5.0

Although I liked it when it worked, the handle became extremely hot while holding it longer than a minute. And then yesterday when I turned it on, it sounded like it was going to explode. I really wanted this to last so much longer. Guess it's going in the electronic recycling bin.<br /><br />Sept 2015 Review: I've had this dryer for a year now and it's held up amazingly! The attachment I use is still attached and works great, and has never fallen off.<br />My only concern after a year is the handle gets extremely hot now and I have to set it down after a few minutes. I have thick, wavy hair so it takes a little time to dry. Also, the handle (where my thumb holds the dryer) is starting the wear and there's a worn section. I'm still using this dryer, despite the handle getting over heated.<br /><br />Aug 2014 Review: Great dryer, good price, good overall! Nice long cord, drys much faster than my last 2 dryers. I love all the attachments and the fact they don't fall off when you use them. I have very wavy hair and using a large round boar brush and now much easier to straighten.

It does a great job of drying my thick, coarse and frizzy hair in a short period of time and without as much frizz as other hair dryers, even my previous Conair. I was pleasantly surprised that it is quite lightweight. My major concern with it is that the finger control to turn it on and to high, low and off is very cheaply constructed and designed. My previous Conair dryer was easy to maneuver with my thumb but this has been redesigned to look sleek but not have enough gripping surface, especially when you have hair produce on your hands. I often find myself using my opposite hand to try to nudge it upward and have almost broken the control off with my (short) fingernail in the process.

I don't like a dryer that gets too hot, and I was pleased that even the high setting doesn't get so hot that I feel like it's trying to bake my hair rather than dry it. The low setting is great for setting my wavy hair during the final moments of drying. It has a good weight that is substantial without being cumbersome and a good-sized grip. My hair is prone to static and this unit doesn't induce that unpleasant state.

Buy $11 worth of lottery tickets, donate the $11 to charity, buy ice cream, anything else.... just don't waste your money on this junk!!!!!<br /><br />Honestly, I LOVED this little dryer for 6 weeks (just after the return period ended), now i have to throw it in the garbage!  The only issue i had with it (when it was working) was actually just an inconvenience/design flaw - as another reviewer said:  The buttons are on the inside of the handle and are the toggle style. You have to hold it just right so you don't turn it off or change the heat setting.<br /><br />THEN IT DIED - - -  DEAD, DEAD, DEAD!<br /><br />I was amazed that this hair dryer could sell for $11, it even comes with a diffuser and other accessories. I only used the dryer every other day for 6 weeks (so about 21 times) for about 5 - 10 minutes (max) each time...  I thought i was getting a cheap dryer, but overall it was VERY expensive:  If I bought a new $11 dryer every six weeks, that would be over $100/year - I could spend half that on a really nice hair dryer that would last years!<br /><br />The return policy expired but i could mail it to Conair ($12 postage) along with a check for $7.00 and then wait weeks for them to decide if they wanted to repair it or replace it (maybe they would, maybe they wouldn't).  So, then i would have $30 into a hair dryer that, if they choose to replace it, would be replaced with the same junk that would last another few weeks?????  I am not that stupid, I will cut my losses at $11.<br /><br />I know that so many other people have had the same problem with the short lifespan of this dryer -  i wish i had taken the time to read all the reviews.<br /><br />Conair & Amazon should stop selling these items, they know they are junk - that's why they offer them so cheap & that people are going to buy them because they are so cheap.

Since I was headed to Europe I switched to 240 Volts and put it inside my suitcase. Once I arrived at my hotel I was very disappointed to find out, that once you switch to 240V you cannot flip the power switch to HIGH, you must try to dry your hair on the LOW setting which is no better than the hotel hair dryer. At first I thought it was just bad luck and went to try out my daughter's dryer ( I purchased two of these dryers since I was traveling with four teenage girls).  Their's did the same.  You can verify this at home, just put it on 240V and try to switch it to high with the dryer unplugged, you'll see that the switch won't move.  You can only go from OFF to LOW.

My last dryer did a great job with this feature, making my hair look smooth and shiny. But on this dryer, pushing this button is like going into a wind tunnel. Why would the makers kick the cool setting up to super-dooper-strong like the high setting? It blows your style to prices after you have just spent the time to create it!

I felt confident when ordering the brand name because I figured they had years of experience with these products. I purchased this item new in the box and I have had wall mount dryers before and are an easy install.  Conair's metal wall mount holes in the plate were too small for the screws given. There was no way to screw them into the plate to attach to the wall.  I had to search my garage for self tapping metal screws to match the hole size and finally after a good hour or so was able to attach the wall plate that holds the dryer. Once I unpacked the dryer and hung it on the wall plate, I noticed the dust cover on the back of the dryer looked loose. After inspecting the problem, I found that one of the prongs that hold it to the dryer was missing. To add to all the existing problems the grip that hold the hair dryer handle was so loos that it hardly held the hair dryer in place when it is sitting back in the cradle.<br />I called Conair customer service to see what they could do for me and I was told they have no parts for this hair dryer.

Honestly, It has been used 24/7/365 for just about 2.5 years which for me qualifies as a resounding endorsement of the product (at the time I paid $11).

I had to place thick cushions on my folding chair, which is somewhat low,  to sit high enough for my head to be covered under the dryer.  I wasn't able to adjust the height locking knob to lower the hood.  I'll have to call on my son again.  I love the convenience of giving my hair a deep heat conditioning, rinsing, rolling it on rollers, then drying it with my own professional bonnet style hood dryer.  My curls were soft and springy.

I pulled the dryer plug immediately and put the dryer on a paper towel and it continued to seem to melt.  Red kept flowing from it for quite awhile.

R3F4RQ6N25YEA0,15213284,486774008,4,0,N,True,0,Good Blowdryer,"So when I went to look for a blowdryer all I really wanted it have was attachments- because I realized that not all blowdryers come with attachments- especially the one for curly hair with the little prongs. When I saw this one, I was pretty much mesmerized - not only did it come with attachments( including the diffuser), but it was pink and it a had button that would reel the cord in for you. When I got it though, did that remain true? Yes! the length of the cord might not be the longest but it isn't short either- it's a rather standard size I suppose. It works perfectly like any other blowdryer. I think the only reason I am putting four stars at this point is because after being so into the reeling feature , the reel started having problems about 2-3 months into owning the blowdryer. Was it serious? No, I can still push the cord into the blowdryer and everything is working fine. So if this isn't going to be a problem with you I'd recommend it. It was a good buy, and I ended up coming back and buying another one of these for a friend.",6/17/2014,4,4.0

R27EEORK6V6OHO,30232948,107341965,5,1,N,True,1,Finally a hair dryer that does exactly what it should...,"I looked for months to find a hair dryer that had 3 heat settings (low, med, high) AND 3 actual fan speeds (low, med, high). It drives me crazy that manufacturers include OFF as a fan speed when in my mind, off is the lack of speed.<br /><br />Anyway, this hair dryer is exactly what I was looking for. I've been using it for a couple weeks now. I wanted to get some uses under my belt before I wrote a review. The review is long but I'm trying to cover all the topics.<br /><br />Fan Speeds:<br />High: It's a good high speed but not one that will blow you into the next room. I'd compare it to a high speed found on a good quality salon dryer.<br />Med: FINALLY!!! A real medium speed. I have very fine hair. It was hard for me to use 2 speed dryers because usually the low was too low and took forever to dry my hair and the high would make me look like I stuck my finger in an electrical socket. The medium speed was enough to dry my hair in a reasonable time and allow me to style it.<br />Low: A reasonable low speed. Good for curly hair to keep it from frizzing.<br /><br />Heat Settings:<br />High: Certainly hot but not so much that it burned my fingers or scalp when drying.<br />Med: This is the setting I use most. It has enough heat to dry my fine hair quickly without causing it to look damaged.<br />Low: Nice to use for curls or a slower, more refined dry style.<br /><br />Noise level: Much quieter than I thought it would be. I have some more expensive dryers that I'd like to wear ear plugs with. Even my boyfriend commented on the lower sound.<br /><br />Buttons/Controls: Some people have commented on the stiffness of the slide adjustments. Are they stiff? A bit. But honestly, I'd rather them that way. The slide controls for the fan and heat are right where you are going to hold the dryer when using it. In my opinion, they need to be stiff so you don't move them accidentally when you are using the dryer. Nothing I hate more than drying my hair only to have my thumb hit a switch to high and blast myself on accident. I have arthritis in my hands and fingers but I don't find the slides hard to move. It just takes a deliberate motion to move them up or down. The cold shot button is easy to push in and not difficult to hold for longer periods if you need to.<br /><br />Attachments: It comes with a diffuser and a concentrator attachment. Both function quite well. They snap in, so no falling off while you're using them. The push buttons used to detach are easy to push.<br /><br />As a whole:<br />This dryer is a fantastic buy! I'm going to order another one to keep as a back up. The cord has a nice little strap to keep it bundled up if you need to travel with it or store it. The 3 real fan speeds and heat settings are what you would expect them to be. It doesn't get hot on the exterior when you use it and it won't blow out your eardrums either which gives it a big thumbs up in my book. The color seems pretty close to what is pictured on Amazon's site; it's nice, but I really didn't buy it for looks. It dries hair quickly and without causing frizz. There was no buyers remorse with this guy. It was well worth the time I spent looking and well worth the money I paid.switch to high and blast myself on accident.

Immediately, I liked the color and how light it was. I really wanted to love this dryer, I promise.<br /><br />So, I get it out of the box and unwrap it. Comes with a set of instructions and an individually wrapped concentrator. Never really use those, but cool, okay. I attach the concentrator to the blowdryer, and plug it in - not near any kind of water whatsoever, I assure you.<br /><br />I let it blow out air for a few seconds and adjusted the heat. No lie, literally TEN SECONDS after it was turned on, the blow dryer turned an intense red color. I thought it was just a gimmicky effect, but NO -- the heat was spreading quickly toward the handle and it became unbearable to hold due to the heat within miliseconds. I quickly shut it off, only to see SPARKS FLYING OUT OF THE DRYER. FOR A GOOD FIVE SECONDS.<br /><br />Okay, maybe I did something wrong. Maybe it was a fluke. I take off the concentrator just for good luck, and plug it in again. The thing roars to life, becoming red, and starts to shoot out sparks again almost immediately. A few unfortunate strands of my hair are caught in the frenzy of it all, and are singed.<br /><br />I'm so glad that I didn't wait until I actually had to DRY MY HAIR to test this item out -- who knows what would've happened if the dryer were closer to my hair????<br /><br />I thought I got a lemon of a product, but a quick google search proved me otherwise -- check the one-star ratings here, and you'll know what I'm talking about.

Outlet is on one side of the hand towel rack; I had to mount it on the other side so the cord is flopping at a diagonal under the towels. I wanted to mount the dryer higher but the cord wouldn't reach.<br />  *  I also use the dryer to other parts of my body due to psoriasis which is aggravated by moisture and  my feet which are prone to moisture related problems and the cord between the base and the dryer makes doing this awkward.<br />  *  Night light is OK doesn't affect my sleep.

I would not invest in this as your every day dryer as you can get a better full-size dryer for the price but if you travel a lot, as I do, the voltage option is key. It's a lot heavier and bulkier than the typical travel hair dryer so I would not recommend this if you're looking for something small. There is a hinge at the handle that allows it to fold but it's still far from compact.<br /><br />I've been taking this dryer with me to Europe and it works great.

I can not believe this has happened again.  I will not be trying to run this company down again as the first time was hassle enough.  Save your time, money and energy by purchasing from a well known brand.<br /><br />Edit:  I received my replacement hair dryer today and I hope the cool shot button doesn't give me trouble because I really love this hair dryer! Thank you!<br /><br />This dryer is very quiet and I am impressed by how hot it can get. Most of the time I use it on warm only as hot can get too hot really fast. I loved it until this morning. I pressed the Cool Shot button to set my curl and the button would not pop back up. Thank goodness I was nearly done blow drying my hair because I could only blow cold air unless I physically pried the button back up. Even if I barely touched the Cool Shot button with my finger, it would blow cold and I would again have to pry it back out. So now I am stuck with an expensive 6 month old dryer that will only blow cold. Waiting to hear back from the manufacturer about the warranty. It's more of a hassle than anything, especially with our humid summer starting and no blow dryer to tame this frizz ball.",5/27/2014,5,3.0
RS0M642Q94MOK,12146701,685652978,4,2,N,True,2,Good for deep conditioning.,"I heard about this type of product through word of mouth. I was speaking to a co-worker about hair care. She told me she uses this type of product for deep conditioning. I didn't know this type of product existed prior to our conversation. I compared prices between this product and the Leila Ali version. I purchased this version because it was the cheapest of the two. I read the reviews after the purchased, and was disappointed because most of them were negative. People were saying that it only lasted for ten minutes. Contrarily,  the product last as long as I want. However, I have not been successful with roller sets.  I just realized that it has a drawstring on my third use. My roller sets might not have came out the way I wanted because I did not adjust the drawstring and because I need smaller rollers. Other than that, its great for deep conditioning and hot oil treatments. I will try once more for a roller set.

R2H0OESG0N61QI,51848386,694290590,5,1,N,True,1,Best ten bucks I've ever spent!,"First of all, let's put things in perspective -- I am not a stylist.  I don't use a blow dryer to style my hair, but rather to dry it after showering.  I have very thin, fine hair that dries quickly but easily gets frizzy and fly-away.  The hand dryer I've had for over 15 years did the job, but unless I used a leave-in conditioner before drying, my hair would often end up looking like shredded wheat.  Not attractive!<br /><br />So when it came time to buy a new dryer, I took a look at the ionic ones, which claim to leave hair soft and silky instead of frizzy and fly-away.  And since this one was so inexpensive, I figured I'd give it a try.<br /><br />Well, it's fabulous!  When dried with this dryer, my hair actually feels silky.  And my hair has NEVER felt silky!  And to make things even better, that silkiness lasts between shampoos.<br /><br />I've read a few complaints here that the blower on this dryer isn't strong enough, or it doesn't get hot enough.  They may have a point -- the air emitted does seem to be less hot than my much older Conair.  But the blower seems strong enough for me.  My hair dries in about the same amount of time as it did with my old dryer.<br /><br />But what makes this so great isn't the heat or the amount of air, it's the ionic thing.  I don't know why it works, or how it works, but I love this thing, and the fact that it actually costs LESS than the one I bought fifteen years ago is just icing on the cake.<br /><br />It's a great dryer and it won't set you back much.

Having worked at Ulta during college, I grew to love the Hot Tools products.  I was waiting to purchase this brand of hair dryer after using other Hot Tools styling tools when my hair dryer finally gave out.  On the day that my blow dryer finally died, I quickly purchased this model.  Sure, it has several speed and heat settings, but it's nothing special.  My itty bitty hair dryer from 2000 did as good of a job as the ion/ceramic/multi-function hair dryers of present day.  I don't think you're going to notice a difference in dryers until you really jump into a different price bracket with the T-3s and Chi's.  i think I could have spend about $15 less and still achieved the same look and quality.

A couple of things that knocks this down to 4 stars instead of 5 is that you cant use the switches to keep it on a cool setting only the cool shot button, but holding down on that button while trying to get my entire head feels akward to me.

R34RDPZXGRF2AI,11966599,127343313,4,224,N,True,230,Great STYLER dryer,"I am a cosmetologist of just about a decade. The main reason that I purchased this dryer was its price, practicality and its brand. Andis is one of the leaders in professional clippers in the hair industry, so I figured that I would give this dryer a shot. I have fine/normal curly just to about the ears, and this dryer gets it QUITE straight.I must admit that the &#34;high velocity&#34; air speed is not there, however, The HEAT is REALLY intense. As a professional, if I had to compare this to a standard salon dryer, performance wise, I would say that it acts a lot like the original Chi dryers, low speed, INTENSE heat, with ionic coating to break water molecules up faster. Now, that being said, if someone wants a dryer that really BLOWS the water out of the hair, I would recommend, concerning affordability and professional performance, the Babyliss 2800,  not that weighty and TRULY cuts drying time, in half, has a 3 year warranty AND Amazon sells it for half the retail price .<br /><br />This little Andis dryer works great for hair shorter than top of the shoulders, if you have really thick/curly or long hair, I would recommend use a T parting in your hair (draw a straight line with a wide toothed comb from the center of your eyebrows, to the back of your neck and comb each section down, from the very top of your head, draw a line from ear to ear to make a lower case 't' on your head) and do your hair in quadrants, (clipping them with butterfly clamps helps to keep other sections out of your way) 3-5 min extra prep time, but works WONDERS for straightening effectively, and saves you time in the end.<br /><br />This dryer does exactly what it says, it 'styles' hair, quite nicely might I add.The attachments are better than other vertical dryers that I have owned.The brush attachment is boar bristle, which allows one to naturally distribute oil through the hair, which is essential to a less frizzy and smoother blow dry. For those who have coarse, thick,tightly curled, or all of the above, use the comb attachment that best suits you, and use the brush to set and smooth it in the direction that you would like it to go, this will 'mold' your hair. Air cool the section that you are working on,The cool shot button on ANY dryer is almost useless, takes too long to cool, by the time it does, the section that you are working on is practically almost ready and is 'set'.<br />Overall, this is a four star dryer, it comes with a FIVE year warranty, it's very hot, and it is great for people (like me) who suffer from carp-tunnel and arthritis in their hands.

How confusing!  I finally decided upon the Argan Heat because no one on Amazon rated it below 3 stars.  This was the first time I ever bought a hair dryer over $30.00.  Using the Argan Heat made me realize that the reason my hair was so dry, fragile and difficult to grow was because my cheap hair dryer was damaging my hair. Now my hair dries quickly, feels silky and looks healthy.  My complaints about this hair dryer are that the warm setting is barely luke warm,  the low-speed setting blows too hard, and the concentrator attachment is difficult to screw/push on (it does not slide on as the box says).  I am not bothered by the weight, and the predominant sound the dryer makes is a pleasant, quiet whoosh, but there is also an underlying straining motor sound that has me concerned.

R2PG9P9868OYN7,16461417,486774008,4,1,N,True,1,A good value with good features,"I have purchased both, this Conair model 223NP and the Andis model 81290 hair dryer. The Andis is more feature packed (see my separate review). The Conair is a bit quieter than most hair dryers I've owned including the Andis model. I used a db digital sound meter to measure the difference, the Conair was only 76db vs. 83db from the Andis model with the sound meter set at 8 inches from the side of the dryers. The Conair is packed with 1875 watts which is more than enough to dry long thick hair. There are 2 heat settings (low & high) and a cool setting. The cool setting is the same temperature as when using the cool shot button (no heat at all). The air intake on the back is a 1-3/4 inch round opening covered by a removable lint screen. The opening is a bit small when compared to the Andis model which is larger at 2-3/8 inches and has side air intakes as well. This begs the question of reliability of the Conair because overheating of the motor is a prone problem of all hair dryers and with a small air intake opening on the Conair model, this could cause more heat build up of the motor. Only time will tell. The unit has 2 blower speeds, although I wish it had 3 for more versatility. The velocity of airflow without the concentrators attached is nearly the same for both models. Air temperature at maximum is 162 degrees on the Conair and 198 degrees on the Andis using a digital temperature probe set at 3 inches from the nozzel without the concentrator attached, all be it both models will dry your hair quickly and satisfactory. The retractable cord is nice and measures 5 feet + 3 inches with 5-1/2 inches that does not retract into the handle. The retracter is a bit stronger than the Andis model but it will still require you to help feed the cord all the way to its end. The dryer does come with a 3 year warranty but the Andis model comes with a generous 5 year warranty. Both the Conair and the Andis models weigh nearly the same and the ergonomics are virtually the same.  My favorate choice between the two models is the Andis because of the longer warranty and the design & feature advantages it has over the Conair (see my separae review) but given all the features of the Conair model and its stylish color and includes a defuser attachment, I give it a solid 3.5 stars.favorate choice between the two models is the Andis because of the longer warranty and the design & feature advantages it has over the Conair (see my separae review) but given all the features of the Conair model and its stylish color and includes a defuser attachment, I give it a solid 3.5 stars.",4/25/2014,4,4.0

R3LT6X76AC0GCI,32190444,415057628,5,2,N,False,3,Great product !,The dryer as advertised on this picture is the one I have. The wats is 1300 which not 1875 like other dryers. It's better for ur electric bill. It's veryyyyy hot on the hot setting. So I think medium setting is best where it's still hot but bearable. The cool setting feels mediocre cool. And the burst is actually cold. Let me tell u. Ive had this dryer at least 2 yrs. I used it an entire winter season to warm up a 15x16 room. It ran 6 hrs straight every day. N the motor died at the end of the season. I wouldn't recommend this b done. It's was just my experience with this dryer. Just letting u know its a strong dryer long lasting if used the correct way. It's not light weight. But very well built. It's had many hard falls to the floor over the yrs. Also it has a safety feature on the plug housing to not turn on if theres an electrical feed interference in a socket. To reset it just press the bottom on the plug.

Secondly, I have used the same Revlon Ionic $15-20 blowdryer since I was about 16years old and never had any problems with it. I always repurchased the same one maybe once every 6years or so.<br /> My hair is naturally curly but its slowly lost most of its curl through the years and been left with a good amount of volume and wave. My hair had always gotten pretty frizzy when I blew it dry but I just figured that was part of the drying process. One day while at work I was looking at a T3 and discussing how my hair frizzes, i was told that with the new hair dryers and such that this isnt what should be happening and that i should get a new high end hair dryer. I researched many of the new T3 and the Drybar products only to be pretty disappointed considering the price. I actually bought a T3 and had problems with the end staying on it and the location of the switch and my hand. I had found the Elchim but was skeptical of it bc of the name in general. I wasnt a big name brand and no one i talk to had ever heard of it. After ONE use I could tell a huge difference. It doesnt dry my hair any faster though. I dont have any frizz and it is smoother, smells better, not to hot to touch, and a lot more shine!

She has fine hair that lacks body.  As I researched dryers I read that people with fine hair will get better volume & body if they don't use NEGATIVE Ion dryers but instead use NEUTRAL Ion dryers.  The price on the MK-II was about $30 more than the TT3000 (which she liked) but I thought that with all the 5 star comments (i.e. lighter weight, quieter, 4 yr warranty, etc.) it was worth it, especially since it had a Negative/Neutral Ion switch.  When it came I mentioned all of its advantages to her.  I was crushed when her first comments were:<br />1. Yes, its quieter than the TT3000 but that's because on high fan the air volume was equal to the low fan speed of the TT3000.<br />2. No, the neutral Ion setting didn't give her any more body/volume than the TT3000 did.<br /><br />It is 2.5 ounces lighter than the TT3000 (according to our digital postage scale) and she's OK with it's performance so I'm not sending it back but I wished I'd just gotten another TT3000 and saved the $30.  Maybe a $180 unit with neutral Ion's would give her more volume but I do know that if this one breaks I'm not buying another MK-II.  Sure wished someone would have posted a comment like this one so I didn't waste my money.  Personally, I like the build quality of the TT3000 also.",3/13/2014,3,3.0

R36X0ORS7SVLR,34167424,423960,1,0,N,True,0,"If you're looking for a retractable cord, don't buy this one!","My previous Conair blow dryer had a retractable cord and I loved it.  It was great for easy storage and my storage space is limited and cramped.  After years though, that blow dryer died and I needed to replace it.  I always go with Conair because they make a trusty, yet inexpensive, product.  I chose this one because of the retractable cord, the folding handle, and the dual voltage.  I figured that if the retracting cord helped with storage, the folding handle has to be even better, right?  Plus, I'm traveling internationally this year, so I thought the folding handle would be good for a suitcase and the dual voltage would be good for international power conversion.  While I had high hopes for his blow dryer, it has really been nothing but disappointing...<br /><br />The blow dryer itself works great, like any other Conair I've owned.  The retracting cord, the folding handle, and the dual voltage switch, however, do not.  The joint on the folding handle is quite flimsy.  The top of the blow dryer wobbles a bit back and forth and I'm sure this will only get worse over time.  This feature doesn't seem built to last.  The retractable cord also doesn't retract.  It gets stuck halfway through and still leaves about a foot and a half of cord sticking out of the end of the blow dryer.  It's not a huge deal since the blow dryer still works, but it is definitely irritating since I bought the blow dryer specifically for this feature.  I don't know for sure, but in my opinion, I think the retractable cord doesn't work right because of the folding handle.  It just seems like that whole area is made flimsy and I think the cord is getting stuck inside the blow dryer near the joint of the handle.  And finally, the dual voltage switch--I can't, for the life of me, get that thing to switch over.  I've tried using my acrylic nails, a screwdriver, my boyfriend, etc. and nothing has worked.  Unless you're traveling with Thor, I wouldn't count on this feature.  Luckily I have a power converter for other electric items, so I can use that with the blow dryer...if it makes it that long.  I may chuck the thing out a window next week!<br /><br />If anybody is interested in the Conair blow dryer I had prior to this one, it was the Conair YOU Cord Reel 2-in-1 Hair Dryer.

R2OVJS2K4BS9MS,47721737,732252283,5,4,N,True,4,Great hairdryer,"I have a lot of hair. It's waist length, and thick. I used a plastic Conair Ion Shine 1875 hair dryer prior to buying this one. I could dry my hair with the Conair in maybe 15-20min. With the Remington, I can dry my hair in 5-10min! As for the less frizz the pearl ceramic plate is supposed to deliver, I think my hair is less frizzier... I have no idea if this is because of that, or because this dryer can sustain heat and air flow well enough to straighten my hair better.<br /><br />The colors are a bit off from the product image. The removable cap on the back of the dryer is a darker shade of pink, while the buttons and the ceramic plate are a lighter pink (but the product image's pink is a lot lighter). The unit itself is a dark maroon or purple-ish sort of color. It's not black. The material is not plastic. It has an interesting finish... smooth but doesn't slide around on a marble countertop like plastic does). The entire hairdryer is a bit heavier than I'm used to, but it's not too much of a big deal as long as you keep your hairdryer steady and you don't swing it about. Since it dries my hair in just a few minutes, the weight really isn't an issue. The cord is a decent length, but I use this at the sink, so I don't need a very long cord.<br /><br />I like the extra heat so I always have my heat set to the third level. The second level is probably better for finer hair. My hair is thick, so I like more heat. The first level is only slightly warm. It's just slightly warmer than the cold shot setting.<br /><br />As for the air speeds... I also like to use the highest setting. The second highest setting is just as fine, but if I'm in a rush, I blast the settings to dry my hair quickly. The air flow is very strong, so with finer hair, you're probably better off at a lower setting here as well. I noticed that other reviews have said they actually keep the hairdryer about 8in from their head to avoid burns. Just to give you a better understanding of my hair, I use the highest settings for both heat and speed, and I place this a lot closer to my head than 8in. So much hair, and I like it long.<br /><br />Overall, hairdryer is heavy, but the heat and the air speed is fantastic for anyone with a lot of hair that's thick and long. Saves me time in the morning when getting ready, and my hair isn't as frizzy. Bonus points: After placing my order, I received this unit the next morning. I'm impressed with the Prime shipping speed with this one.highest settings for both heat and speed, and I place this a lot closer to my head than 8in.

I wanted it because I really like the &#34;hot comb&#34; style.  After receiving it and noting the similarities with my old unit I would bet that Andis manufactured the dryer for Vidal Sassoon.  Not only was the design almost identical, but the comb and brush attachments were identical and, in fact, would interchange perfectly with my old unit.  If that is the case, this one should also last for many trouble free years.  It does have one design feature that caused some initial confusion.  The unit has three heat settings but there are only two fan speeds.  The fan operates at the same speed on both medium and high heat settings which makes it appear that the switch is not doing anything.  A check with my ammeter revealed, however, that the electrical load does increase a few amps and the air does get hotter in the high position.  I am not saying that this is any kind of a problem, but I just thought it unusual since my old one had three fan speeds.<br /><br />I would personally question the part about the &#34;ionic&#34; feature &#34;breaking up water molecules&#34; to accelerate drying but the ad writers gotta have something to do.<br /><br />At any rate, it was just what I was looking for and does a great job.",2/25/2014,5,5.0

I am a black woman with natural hair (absolutely no chemicals nor weave) and my hair is more susceptible to dryness and breakage.  Therefore, it is extremely important for me to be extra sensitive and mindful to the type of products I use on my hair. This dryer did not pull my hair out, no burnt smell and I didn't mind the sound quality, afterall it is a hair dryer not a fan. The only negative I have is that the buttons can easily be depressed while blow drying your hair.  So you may have to double check a few times as I did to make certain you are using the right temperature on your hair.  Here is a tip I learned, when planning on using hot curlers, flat irons etc. please cool your hair down first (the cool shot button truly does help)and use a non-buildup non-oily heat treatment.  The more natural and/or organic the better. Wait at least 10 minutes or longer before proceeding to styling. Heat from the dryer with immediate usage of other heat sources can cause stress and unnecessary damage (or more damage) to your scalp and hair. Also, when using the pik, if you come in contact with a tangle, PLEASE do not force the pik thru.  You will tear your hair apart.

I'm tempted to buy another and just stash it in the closet in case it discontinues before I need a new one. It dries my hair so quickly and leaves it smoother than I've ever experienced from a dryer. I'm notorious for showering at night simply so that I don't have to bother with drying my hair because it takes too much time in the mornings, but this dryer makes what is generally a lengthy and annoying process a quick, simple thing.

I purchased a hairdryer at a local beauty supply chain, thinking that it would work about as well as my dearly departed one. Wrong! It left my hair feeling very dry, in spite of the product I use on my hair prior to blowing it dry. I was going to invest in a CHI, but after reading mostly negative reviews on that model, I decided to save my money and get this Andis hair dryer. I have very thick, coarse, long hair (4 inches past my shoulders), and I'm transitioning from relaxer to natural. I have about 3-4 inches of new growth, and the rest is still relaxed, so straighter styles work for the time being. This hair dryer is EVERYTHING! Not only was it easy on the wallet, it gets my hair dry super quickly, while not sucking all of the moisture out of my hair. It takes less than 20 minutes to dry my hair, which is quicker than even my original blow dryer, and gets my roots pretty straight (I use the small tooth comb attachment). It's easy to hold and gets hot without burning my scalp. Coupled with my Sedu flat iron, my hair is almost salon quality, super soft and shiny!

And trust me, when it comes to a product you're going to be using almost everyday, you do not want it to be annoying.<br /><br />1) STIFF BUTTONS -- The buttons are flush with the surface of the handle, and they're intended to be slid up and down.  Unfortunately, they're incredibly stiff and difficult to move.  I have to use my fingernail every time (which is irritating and uncomfortable), and even then I often have to fidget/wiggle it around.  Sometimes it takes a couple of tries.<br /><br />2) ATTACHMENT FALLS OFF -- Oh man.  Ugh.  I use the concentrator attachment, and seriously, the touch of a feather is enough to knock that thing off the dryer.  Literally every time it falls off in the middle of use.  If not once, then twice, sometimes even three times.  The worst part is that, once it falls off, it then bounces around the bathroom, making a HUGE clattering ruckus, before finally landing somewhere.  This seems to happen most often when other people are still asleep and I'm trying to be quiet.  My boyfriend is always highly amused at the #*$& that comes out of my mouth when this happens.<br /><br />And now, after about a year of frequent use, the dryer has begun to make loud sparking noises.  No visible sparks, just the sound... but I'm not about to wait for actual fire before I toss this.  I'd like to keep my hair, thanks.  I'm already shopping for another one.  Honestly, I'm not even that put out.

The problem is that this hairdryer has too much power on the low speed for a polished set and style.<br /><br />I wanted a hairdryer that would complete the first 50% of hair drying quickly, but then allow me to use a lower speed with my round brush to get a smooth finish. This dryer just has too much power going to it at the low speed setting, which means I get lots of flyaways. If you always flat iron or curl after drying, or if you don't care about style and just want to get your hair dry fast, or (maybe) if you have really thick strands, this could be a great dryer. With my medium-fine hair, I just can't get that polished set that I'm looking for. My hair does feel nice after I dry it, and if I'm planning to curl or flat iron after drying then I really appreciate how fast I can get my hair dry. However, I don't like that I MUST flat iron or curl my hair to get it to look finished. If this dryer had a third, lower speed setting, or if the low speed setting had 30% less power, this would be a GREAT hairdryer.

You won't regret this purchase,"This is a GREAT dryer and my review will compare the Sedu Revolution 4000i with the Harry Josh Pro Dryer 2000.<br /><br />When the Harry Josh 2000 dryer came out I was dying to buy it but just couldn't justify the price. I was in desperate need of a good dryer (since I straighten my hair almost every day).  After lots of research and reading reviews on every single dryer out there, I decided to go with the Sedu Revolution TGR 4000i. Especially since it was chosen by Harry Josh himself as HIS FAVORITE DRYER (obviously before he developed his own dryer)…so I figured the Sedu was a great choice. I've loved this dryer since day 1. Love it. But…I still had my heart set on the Harry Josh dryer. I figured it would be even better than the Sedu and somehow cut my dry time to mere seconds :)<br />I finally justified the purchase of the Harry Josh by telling myself that my Sedu would be my travel / back up dryer. After all, everyone needs an emergency blow dryer!<br /><br />So the Harry Josh dryer arrives and I immediately notice it's the same exact body casing as the Sedu. Even the attachments are exact and fit on both dryers. EVERYTHING and I mean everything right down to the cord length, switches, markings and body size were exact. Even the motor sounds exactly the same when turned on. The only difference I can see is that one is mint green and one is black.<br />Now I admit, I don't know what kind of motor each one has, but it seemed strange to me that Harry's new $250-300 dryer appears to be the exact same machine as his once beloved &#34;favorite dryer.&#34; So I decided to perform my own dry test and see which one, if any, dried my hair faster and made it smoother.<br /><br />I tested for six total days. For three days I dried with the Sedu and for three days with the Harry Josh. I alternated days to account for weather, humidity in the air, more or less product applied, etc.<br /><br />On all six days I followed the same exact routine (water temp / shampoo / conditioner / other hair product)<br /><br />Here's what I found:<br /><br />The Sedu Revolution dried my hair approximately one to two minutes faster than the Harry Josh on all days. On average, using the Sedu, it took about 5:30 min to get my hair dry and approx 7 minutes to dry it with the Harry Josh.<br /><br />The Harry Josh DID make my hair a slightly smoother, but nothing really earth shattering.<br /><br />I decided to keep my Sedu and return the Harry Josh.<br /><br />Note: My hair is slightly longer than shoulder length, curly, fine, and a little frizzy. It's also color treated.<br /><br />So all in all, I highly recommend the Sedu Revolution TGR 4000i dryer. Even though it's expensive it's totally worth it if you straighten your hair a lot.

R1SACVPAOMG0A8,38431431,179801564,3,0,N,True,4,Pointless,"While preparing for a few weeks in Europe, my girlfriend mentioned bringing her hair dryer. I explained that hair dryers can't simply be plugged into an adapter. You need a complicated, often expensive, voltage converter that can handle the power draw of a high wattage appliance.<br /><br />I figured for the price of a converter we could likely just find a 220v hair dryer and then rather than carry her giant hair dryer, AND a bulky converter, we'd just have one compact device.<br /><br />As it turns out, we stayed in several hotels, and ALL OF THEM had hair dryers in them. We didn't need to bring anything at all. Moreover, this one is pretty weak, and the ones in the hotels tended to be much better.<br /><br />So my advice is this: if you're going to Europe, don't bother buying and packing a hair dryer. Just use the one in the hotel.

I had to go to the shop and drill out the holes bigger. This took several trips as I wanted to make sure they weren't too big so the small screw head would just go through the hole.

R4ZSBJOD8TM30,13966699,443954263,5,1,N,True,1,Very happy with this purchase!,"I have spent the past few months researching several different hair dryers and finally decided on this one. I'm so glad I did! I have super thick, coarse, long, wavy/curly hair and have been using a cheap drugstore dryer for the past several years. I'm not sure why I never realized that a good hair dryer could make such a difference, but I really wish I had figured it out sooner! I learned this lesson a few years ago when it comes to hair straighteners; I have the T3 Mane Tamer that I absolutely adore. So, I started there. T3 has a few different dryers, all with positive ratings, and all VERY expensive. I wasn't convinced that it would be worth it to spend that much. I read through tons of reviews for this Onei hair dryer and was happy with the positive reviews and the price. It arrived quickly and I couldn't wait to get it out of the box and use it! Normally, I spend a good half hour to 45 mins just getting my hair dry--not blowing it out, not using any brushes or styling tools/techniques, just getting it dry so that I can use my flat iron. The result (before flat ironing) is what I like to call my &#34;white girl afro&#34;--it is big, it is fluffy and it is crazy!<br />After reading some reviews and Q&As, I switched on the negative ion button, got my round brush and went to town. I could not believe how smooth my hair got just from blowing it dry. My technique was sadly out of practice and I did end up using my flat iron on a few spots, but I think that was entirely user error and expect it to get better with a little practice. I really believe that, once I get used to blowing my hair out again, I will be able to dry and style my hair with no flat iron required!!<br />My hair was so smooth and VERY shiny in the end, I was so happy with it. The dryer itself is lightweight and comfortable to hold and use and I love all the options it has with heat/cool, fan speed, etc. The buttons are perfectly located for my taste, not in the way at all and no risk of accidentallypushing buttons while using. I also love that there is both a cool shot (if you just need a quick blast of cool air) and a cool temperature setting (for when you want cool air for an extended period of time). I was also really impressed with how quiet this dryer is. When I first turned it on, it actually made me a little nervous because it was so quiet and I was afraid it wouldn't be very powerful, but that is definitely not the case--plenty of power without all the noise.<br />I am very, very happy with this hair dryer and would absolutely recommend it.",1/8/2014,5,5.0

I had my old hairdryer for at least 6 years and it finally crapped out on me - it was just a Revlon that I had gotten from Walmart or somewhere.  I considered spending about $30 more on a nicer dryer, but decided I'd try a Conair first since it was cheaper and my mom has one that I love using when I go home.  So I ordered this guy (which came in two days - gotta love Amazon Prime when you don't have a working hair dryer) and was initially kind of bummed when I opened it.  I know you get what you pay for, but this one is much lighter than the dryer my mom has, so I was worried it wouldn't work as well.  Turns out my fears were unfounded - this guy is powerful and quieter than my old dryer, and the tourmaline ceramic technology, which they tout as leaving your hair shinier with less frizz, totally works!  My hair has been amazing every day.  I also really like how light it is now that I know it works.

I liked the first one I bought 2 or 3 years ago and it still works fine, using it 7 days a week.  This is fairly Compact, the handle folds up, the retractor works well but I always guide the cord back into the handle when I retract it (if you let it zip closed I believe it places more wear on the rewinding mechanism).  It does get fairly hot, has a cooler setting, plus shot of cold air, not too loud, and comfortable to grip and use.  It would be nice if it had a 240 volt built-in converter but the cost was slightly under twenty bucks and many foreign hotels in the west have built=in converters in their hotel rooms.  I was very pleased with the first one, still up and running fine, and the new one is as good as the old one.  My wife also likes it as she has very thick hair which takes a long time to dry.  She says for an inexpensive hair dryer this does better than most and drys her hair in a reasonable manner.

She said to buy a ceramic brush as well to help with drying and to prevent frizzy hair. After purchasing this hairdryer and the right brush, I am able to dry my hair in 5 minutes as opposed to 15 minutes with a hairdryer bought at like CVS or Rite Aid. I have really thick, medium length hair. Where I live where it gets humid from time to time, my hair does get frizzy. After buying this hairdryer, time and frizz were no longer an issue.

I have thick short hair and asked my stylist what dryer to get next.  I had a cheap drugstore one that had lasted years but was on its last legs.  I have really hesitated to spend a ton of money on a dryer but went ahead and bought this since my birthday was coming up.  I read the reviews before completing the transaction and thought the people who said it dries their hair faster must be crazy.  How would one dryer dry hair significantly faster than another?<br /><br />The answer is I don't know, but it does.  It absolutely does.  I am a convert!  I LOVE this dryer.  I love how small it is.  I packed it on a trip recently and didn't have to stress about how much room it took up in my suitcase.  It is so compact and powerful.  I just adore it.<br /><br />I'm not great at reviewing products I feel strongly about so the fact that I'm even writing this should tell you something.  This dryer really is different than other dryers out there and the higher price is worth every penny.  When you can shave time off of your morning routine every single day, imagine how much of your life you get back?  Now, is that worth extra money?  I am a wash and go girl with little to no interest in makeup, fashion, etc.  I am a mom of three and own a small quilting business.  But I wash my hair every day and have to dry it to tame it.

Every time I went to a hotel, I wrote down the brand with the intention of ordering one. Finally my old blow dryer went kaput, so I had an excuse to purchase this one.<br /><br />First of all, I don't know why the photo shows it somewhat pearly looking: it's plain old white. Second, it was a bit larger than I expected and so it wouldn't fit in the spot I had chosen for it. I ended up having to mount it above a towel bar since if it was below it would either be in the way of the light switches or it would have to under the hand towels and make an odd bulge. So I put it in myself--didn't use the anchors as I think it will stay in place without. I hung a little picture next to it so it wouldn't look so out of place above the towel bar by itself.<br /><br />It works just as expected and I love having it ready to go whenever I am. One advantage I discovered with mounting it higher is that it's never going to get caught on knobs or anything else--a frequent frustration when I'm tired in the morning. We had our first really cold day here (in the South) and I found it's also handy for warming yourself up quickly when coming out of the shower; I've suggested it to my husband for that purpose (he's bald and otherwise wouldn't need it).<br /><br />I'll update my review if I ever have problems with it, but so far it's great--just have to get used to seeing it there on the wall.",11/14/2013,4,4.0

This is the first dryer to ever stop working for me, which isn't the best morning surprise.

I was very happy with the Andis, but I bought the Oster due to it being off-white instead of white which looks a little more high end. I also got the Oster because it had smaller footprint because I installed a new medicine cabinet and I needed a wall mount dryer that would fit in a smaller space. So far, I noticed that it has pretty good blowing power, but it doesn't run as hot as the Andis did, which may be better for my hair so it won't get too hot.<br /><br />The only issue with having a compact hair dryer vs. my previous full sized hair dryer is that the back fan is closer to my head. Because of this, when I held the dryer too close to my hair (which is long) and some hair got sucked into the fan in the back. I had to stop the dryer and untangle my hair from the fan.  This is no fault of Oster, I just have to get used to a shorter length of hair dryer! Just letting others know what to expect. So far I am pleased with the Oster.<br /><br />ETA: It is July 2014, and it hasn't even been a year that I've owned this dryer and my Oster has already died!

I previously had a ConAir and in comparison I think this one is of higher quality.

I noticed that several other reviewers had trouble with getting their hair stuck in the rear vent, I have long hair and have yet to have this problem, but I do agree that a cap of some sort would be nice to prevent this.<br /><br />The hair dryer includes three different heat settings- I found one to be quite hot, one warm, and one cool.

I don't use the comb attachments.  A lot of people complain about the brush attachment, but I guess they never used one growing up and know the trick with the brush.  No it doesn't grab onto your hair like a regular brush does since it's so soft AND because the air is blowing your hair away from the brush itself.  I put my hand on the other side of my hair.

Also on the old ones, I could just take it from the wll mount bracket and use it like a regular Blower, or just put a new one in an old prewall mounted bracket.

It's a comfortable dryer and feels good in the hand without fatiguing it, despite the weight. In the past, I've had the problem of my long hair getting sucked into the dryer. I did not have that issue with this dryer. The one minor complaint I have is that the hot setting didn't feel as hot as I would have liked. The hot feels like more of a medium setting to me so it look a bit longer than I'm accustomed to to dry my hair. As far as the ceramic/ionic nature of the dryer, I'm not fully sure how this works with a blow dryer since it doesn't actually touch the hair like a flat iron or curling iron.

RRZIQFISUGJ4L,17138974,153523919,5,1,N,True,1,The perfect hair dryer?,"How great can a hair dryer be?  Aren't they all the same?  Well, as is true with many things, all hair dryers are not created equal, and this was a GREAT find.  It seems a simple thing -- just turn it on and dry the hair -- but I've been frustrated many times with hair dryers that are too strong, blowing like a hurricane no matter what the setting, too weak, barely putting out a cough of air, or too cold, or too hot, or that just fry themselves after a few months of use.  And, specifically, I wanted a travel hair dryer, since my last supposed &#34;dual voltage&#34; hair dryer went up in smoke (literally!) when trying to use it on the other voltage setting.  So, this hair dryer has been a welcome treat.  Not only does it do as it claims, in being dual voltage, but you still got low and high settings, and the great &#34;cool shot&#34; at either voltage setting.  Air flow and heat are consistent and the low and high settings are really just that -- less heat and air, or more heat and air -- and are noticeable in difference.  Comes with two attachments, as shown, handle folds, plus the back opens up for cleaning!  I have never found such a great hair dryer at even far higher prices, let alone at the great price for this one!

R26OLXOBXOLXQ7,39950463,902572429,5,4,N,True,5,Better than I had expected!,"I highly recommend this dryer if you have thick or coarse hair that needs to be smoothed or straightened. If you are the type of person who just flips the hair around and smooths with fingers, this might be too much dryer for you, but I have no experience with that kind of hair. This is my first professional hair dryer, and I couldn't be happier. I have medium coarse hair (mixed race, ringlets, coarse but not kinky. 3b maybe?) that is currently just below chin length. I'm super-skeptical about product claims, so I did a lot of research. I read an article about a comparison of several models that convinced me of the effectiveness of titanium, and I knew I wanted 2000 watts just cause I wanted as much power as possible. There aren't too many dryers with those 2 features, so after reading the positive reviews, I decided on this model. From the first time I used it, I was very pleased. My hair was definitely softer and smoother. I never believed a hairdryer could make your hair softer, but this one definitely did. I can also dry my hair much more quickly, but I think that is because with this hair dryer, I am actually able to dry my hair like the hairdresser does (in big sections, using the curve of my head to smooth it out.) Previously, I always had to dry my hair in 1-2inch sections wrapping around and pulling with a round brush, which takes FOREVER. If I dry my hair that way with this dryer, it still takes about as long, but I don't really get much better results so I don't bother. CONS: 1. I still have to use a flat iron to smooth my ends. For the life of me, I can't get smooth ends with a hair dryer. I was really hoping this dryer would solve that for me, but instead it has convinced me that it is my technique, not the dryer. 2. It really does get HOT. I have to use medium heat around the edges of my hairline, and that can still be a little intense. If you have a sensitive scalp, this might be too much dryer for you. 3. The nozzles seem kinda cheap. My last hair dryer had  nozzles that snapped on, which made it easier to rotate and change the angle. These nozzles just fit snugly over the barrel and often come off when I try to rotate them. I can't speak to some of the other complaints about this dryer like weight and noise. I wouldn't call this dryer light or quiet, but it doesn't seem particularly loud or heavy to me. Personally, I wouldn't want to give up the performance of this dryer for those features.<br /><br />Hope this review helps, and happy styling everyone!",10/29/2013,4,4.0

My salon is attached to my home and I have a small clientele so I didn't want to spend a lot of money.

We have long, medium, and short hairstyles between us. We all have straight, fine hair and a lot of it. Our hair tends to get flat, not frizzy.<br /><br />The dryer does work faster than other dryers we've had, and it is quieter. Blowouts result in shinier, smoother hair than before. I like the multiple settings, although there is a learning curve, and I found myself pushing the wrong switches at first. The cold shot of air is a real help in styling, especially for short hair styles. We've used the concentrator, and it fits securely and stays on.<br /><br />I thought the dryer was a bit heavy, but my kids (12 and 14) never mentioned the weight. It's been hard to get them to blow dry their hair, but they wanted to use this dryer -- a big plus to me, I admit. (I'd be a stylist if I wanted to give someone a blowout, but I'm not and I don't.) It's a full-sized blow dryer and comes with loop so you can hang it if you wish. I wasn't sure where I wanted to store the dryer, so I temporarily rested in inside the strong box it comes in and tucked the box in my linen closet between a stack of towels and the wall.

It gets the job done and also comes with a diffuser and a concentrator.<br /><br />The barrel is very wide, moves plenty of air, and is one of the quietest hair dryers I've used, but also definitely does not have that strong of a fan. I don't mind this usually, but sometimes if my bangs are acting up I'd really like a large amount of air/heat to put them in place. Usually the concentrator is fine for this but it'd be nice to have a bit more flow.<br /><br />The diffuser is also very nice. I've never really used a diffuser until getting this but it generally keeps my thick, curly hair frizz free as long as I don't dry it completely.

The first thing I noticed when I took it out of the box was it's weight. It's quite heavy, and much heavier than my last two blow dryers. I don't know if I'll get tired of holding something heavier, but I am hoping that it's an indication of quality.<br /><br />I do like the three heat settings, two air speeds and the cool shot of air, which can be used while drying. It is quieter than my last dryer, which was a Conair with the same wattage. The dryer is a little awkward to hold, however, and I had trouble changing heat and speed while holding it midair and drying my hair. It did dry my hair faster but not by much. I used both attachments to see how they work and diffuser worked like it should - giving curl without the frizz. I had trouble getting the concentrator attachment on the end, and then it blew off the dryer both times that I used it. I don't know if mine just doesn't fit well, but that was a little annoying.<br /><br />It may seem like I'm being knitpicky in this review, but I'm just trying to cover all the bases for a blow dryer.

It was fantastic and worked as well as it did the day I bought it, until its coil lit up and a curl of smoke came out the blower. Alas, it was a sad day. I specifically bought this one based on the performance of the other, and it's not lived up to par, by a long shot.<br /><br />I bought this dryer 6 months ago and the retractable cord already doesn't work. That's the WHOLE reason I wanted this model. This one is heavier, hotter, and the cool shot is really just warm. Not to mention, it's hot pink.<br /><br />In all, I'm very disappointed with this dryer, and will look for another retractable one next time. I don't recommend getting this one, if that is the feature luring you.<br /><br />--UPDATE - Sept 2014<br />This hairdryer totally died a month ago. I'd had it 18 whole months, and it completely quit working. No fireworks, no warning, just plugged it in, and nothing. I tried several outlets throughout the house, and it would. not. work.<br /><br />I contacted Conair, and based on its model number, which indicated it was well within warranty, they would replace it for free, sort of. I had to pay $15 in shipping to return it to them. I think that's totally bogus, given that the unit shouldn't have had ANY problems in that timeframe. Hopeful, I sent it along. In about three weeks, they sent me another dryer--same model.<br /><br />Having used the only other dated dryer I had in the house during that three weeks, I can firmly attest that all dryers are not created equally. I recall now why I I loved the predecessor of this dryer, and this one, before it became problematic. It's quieter, the temperature is more controllable, it's well-vented and easily cleaned. Also, the refinement attachments actually fit the former model, snugly. They fall off this one--the one from the deceased predecessor, and the one that came with this replacement. It's virtually no use to me without the attachments.<br /><br />But honestly, I am not motivated to rate it any higher, because I don't have faith this one will last. That it works well is only part of what makes a product great. Longevity is part of the equation, as well.I am not motivated to rate it any higher, because I don't have faith this one will last.

Now for the price its great! the reason I bought this particular one was because I used it at a hotel and liked the product..<br />Now the reason for 3 stars:<br />The quality of the stand and the plastic itself are quite inferior, feel like it gonna crank in about 3 months, the first one I had received had a mold defect and there was a huge dent in the middle so I returned it and got another piece from amazon (easy (and free) return I should say!). But the fact that its quite plastic-ey and the second one I received had the same dent (just smaller) so the finishing is not that great... but I should add it works and does what it should efficiently!

RLEM4KTS1YCED,43636027,328811288,2,7,N,False,7,Not for curly hair,"I got this for an overseas trip after searching through dozens and dozens of reviews of travel hairdryers **that come with diffusers** for my curly hair. I figured, why drop much $ on this if they all are mediocre?  And indeed I am glad I did not spend much on this one.  It does have strong airflow for such a tiny dryer, which is great for non-curly purposes.  But the diffuser does not slow down the air flow very much, and on top of that, the diffuser is SO TINY -- no more than 3 inches in diameter.  The low setting does not generate quite enough heat, but the high setting has too much air flow. I end up switching between low and high to build up some more heat, and only stick the diffuser into the roots of my hair so it doesn't totally blow out all the curls.<br /><br />So if you are picky about drying your curly hair with a diffuser, this probably isn't the travel dryer for you.  If you just want to give your curly hair a head start on air-drying because you will be somewhere cold, it's probably fine for that purpose.  Might be OK if you have very strong tight curls that don't get blown out as easily.  Or maybe you can get crafty and block some of the holes in the diffuser...<br /><br />The dryer did overheat a few times when using it on 220V with an adapter in Europe, but I think as long as you are conscious about not using it on high setting for too long, it should be OK.",9/23/2013,5,4.0

My priorities for a dryer is to not be too loud, and to dry my hair fast. I have thick long hair, and it can take 10-15 mins to get my hair completely dried. My old Conair dryer was working ok, but it was very loud and was taking a lot time to dry. Aesthetically, this dryer is very cute. It is quite large, but I love the texture and the pink accents. Some people had said it was a bit heavy, it is heavier than my Conair, but not too much where I feel like I have trouble holding it. It comes with 2 attachments, a diffuser and a concentrated air nozzle. I use the concentrated air nozzle every day. It is easy to attach and easy to come off. The best thing about this dryer is that it is not very loud at all! And yes, it does dry my hair a LOT quicker. With the help of the concentrated nozzle and a round brush, I can get my hair dry within 5-10 minutes. This is a huge improvement. It comes in 3 settings with 3 levels of heat, as well as a cold air button. The back of the dryer is easy to twist off for you to clean. Overall, I am very pleased with this dryer.

Great feature if you don't leave your blow dryer on the counter all day and are sick and tired of wrapping five feet of cord around the handle every time you're done.  It hangs up when it retracts every once in a while, but it keeps the cord out of the way.<br /><br />This model has more settings than you can think up reasons for.  Two power settigs - 1875W and a second lower setting I never use.  Three heat settings and three blower settings.  And then add a cold blower setting.<br /><br />Only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I also bought an Andis traveler blow dryer (RC-2) for the gym (w/ retractable cord and folding handle) that I like better;",8/26/2013,4,4.0

The dryer was um, well I didn't like it that much. Too make matters worse, the attachment began falling off with the slightest touch. That becomes very annoying since my hair is so thick.... Anyways, I received this dryer on Saturday which was the day it was supposed to arrive. I had missed the delivery, but I was so anxious to get it that I went to FedEx and picked it up. I ordered this along with the Denman Brushes Thermo Straightening Brush (D79) . So I am Black and I have 4b natural hair. I had been trying to straighten my hair for the longest. I also recently purchased a Babyliss Pro TT Tourmaline Titanium 1.5-inch Steam Styler off of overstock.com, which I like way better than the HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch I also purchased last year.<br /><br />So the whole point is, I really like this hair dryer so far.

I was actually looking for a full size hair dryer which is dual voltage. I dont care about weight so much as performance. Cant seem to find one :( But this is waste of money.

That  being said, this is the best I have seen in it's price range. The attachments fit without being whipped across the room for no reason like my others and it dries hair twice as fast as my previous. I don't have as many split ends either. For durability it has held up fairly well being used at least once daily by a complete klutz who drops things. Never any damage, cracking, or peeling. It is also quite pretty! Some say it is heavy in the reviews. While I was used to a lighter one, I only noticed a weight difference the first few times before it seemed normal to me. The only issue I have had with it is that my long hair will sometimes get sucked in the back. I have learned to keep it held higher.

The first one I purchased lasted almost 2 years before it stopped working. Because I take good care of my appliances and they tend to last a long time, I thought I had simply gotten a lemon. It happens to the best products every now and then. Unfortunately, the second one did not perform any better and stopped working after only 7 months.

I much prefer switches that actually protrude from the handle that can be flipped with your thumb, if that makes sense.<br /><br />Anyway, it's not totally useless, I just had some issues with it.

I have had many Conair hair dryers over the years and have always been very happy with them.  I would get many years of use out of them before they finally succumbed.  When my previous hair dryer died I again wanted a Conair since I had good luck with them so I ordered this one.  I loved this dryer all the way up until today.  While drying my hair it just died after about 5 minutes of use.  My hair is not long, just below my shoulder, and usually takes me about 10 to 15 minutes to completely dry depending on time of year.  I thought that maybe I just blew the ALCI so I followed the Operating Instructions to try and reset it.  No luck.  So I let it sit for a couple of hours to then try again....still no luck.  It is dead.  Again, I have had other Conair hair dryers that lasted for many years with no problems.<br />So because this particular dryer only lasting just under 13 months I am giving it the one star.

This one is the nice true compact type I like.  It also has decent quality of wire (some of that cheap wire nowadays hardly bends), and the cord is a generous 6 feet. The long cord is also a big selling point since a lot of the newer dryers have 4 foot cords.  I cannot comment on the international power settings since this will probably only be used in North America.  It does have 2 separate blowing speeds. The high speed is good, but my older dryer is just a little more powerful.  However, this one is good enough and the controls are set up for easy one-handed usage, with high, then &#34;off&#34; then &#34;low&#34; all on one simple power button. My hands are arthritic and this is much easier button placement than having the buttons on the front of the handle.  Also has a hanging loop as shown in the photo and I will be using that rather than folding the cord up after each use to store it.

RG6RUQVT2O4N8,45869523,676407800,4,0,N,True,1,Decent Quality,"It replaced my old ConAir ionShine with retracting cord. I was able to buy those (the old ones) at the big W (you know where) for a reasonable price, but they would die about every 6 to 12 months. When the last one died, they didn't have any on the shelf (go figure). So I tried to find a replacement with this one.<br /><br />It's a shiny red color, but since it spends most of it's life in the cabinet under my sink, I don't think that's a big selling point. I like that this one has a retracting cord, and the fact that it doesn't fold in half like my old ones hasn't been a problem, so far. In fact, it's probably an engineering upgrade. I imagine the folding types break more easily.<br /><br />When I first started using it, it seemed to take a bit longer than average to dry my hair, but after a few uses, it seems to be &#34;broken in&#34; now. I like that it has cold, warm or hot options and low or high speeds. So, all in all, it does the job for a reasonable price and offers the retractable cord (which is a must for those of us who a bit OCD). Only gave it 4 stars because, well, it's not made of gold (which would probably melt from the heat anyway).",6/18/2013,4,4.0

I was replacing an old dryer and was looking for something that would dry my hair quickly and leave it looking smooth.<br /><br />Other reviewers commented on how great the Onei dryer was, citing it's speed in drying, it's ionic component that left hair smooth, and several even mentioned how quiet the dryer was.  The dryer arrived faster than anticipated and I was in love the first time I used it!!  It did dry my hair quickly (the same or faster than other dryers), my hair doesn't require a pass through with a flat iron on most days as it usually did, and it's actually REALLY quiet (like, abnormally so).  While I don't have to worry about waking anyone up, it's quiet enough not to drown out the phone ringing or my music playing while I get ready.<br /><br />The attachments are great...as is the long cord.

I like the cool blower for finishing when the day is hot. I keep pressing the cool shot button accidentally, however, because it's so darn convenient. The cool shot button is exactly where my thumb naturally rests and I have to keep that in mind. The cord is shorter than I'd like, and a good bit shorter than my last dryer. The sliding controls aren't wonderful. The friction ridges are quite flat and the two slides mesh so well and are so narrow that my thumb can't tell them apart. I have to press those flat ridges so hard that it hurts my thumb, so I use my &#34;off&#34; hand to slide the controls. There's some kind of thin, plastic-like finish that's slowly peeling off, but that doesn't bother me at all.<br /><br />My last dryer was a Black & Decker. It was very small and compact and did the job for many years, possibly as much as 20 years. I do still wish I could have replaced it with the same thing.<br /><br />All this sounds like complaining, I know, but they're trivial complaints (except the cord length). I've never had a diffuser attachment before but I found it worth learning to use. I used to dry and style my short, curly hair in about a minute on the hot setting, but now the diffuser and the warm setting do it just as fast and better. The Conair hot setting is pretty hot, so if you need that you'll be happy. Best of all is that, even in the winter, my hair never gets flyaway with static electricity.<br /><br />I've had this Conair less than a year, so I can't comment on its durability.<br /><br />BTW, I bought this upon the recommendation of Consumer Reports. They called it a good value and I certainly agree.<br /><br />I've had it almost 4 years now and it's still trouble-free.",6/17/2013,5,5.0

Being Dominican, I remember going to the salon every Saturday morning since I was 10 with my mother so that we could pay 20-30 dollars for our lady to blow dry my hair.<br /><br />Fast forward a few years (I'm 30 now): I work full time, am married, AND went back to school. So, I don't have time to go to the salon and sit there for hours until my hair gets blown out.<br /><br />Thankfully, with my hair, all I have to do are rollers and sit under the dryer for 40 minutes and boom...no salon, nice waves, better than blown out! Much cheaper than going to the salon, btw.<br /><br />I looove that the dryer has a timer, which means I don't have to watch the clock constantly. The dryer gets VERY hot, almost too hot (I used the highest setting), but that means I spent less time under the dryer. It's not very loud at all, which I also like. Also, in order to adjust height in most dryers, one needs to turn some sort of knob, right? Not with this one! I just push it down as low as I need or pull it up as high as I need, and I'm done. Some people may not be used to his, but it works for me.<br /><br />When I do rollers, I only use the Jumbo/Extra Large ones all around my head. Even so, I'm STILL able to fit under and inside  the bonnet.<br /><br />I took off one star b/c it was a bit challenging putting it together.

On the bright side, this won't burn your hair & will dry without damaging your hair.  Personally, I like it.  Hubby complains, because he wants to turn on the dryer, sweep it over his head about 6 times and be finished.  No go.  What used to take him a minute now takes 3.  But I think his hair looks healthier.  He could care less : )  He's a man on a mission and wasted time frustrates him to no end.  Patience is a virtue, I say, as he rolls his eyes.<br /><br />It has two speeds (I use low).  It was easy to install; I did it myself in about 3.5 minutes (really easy).  You use 2 screws to screw a small metal plate onto the wall in your desired hanging location, within reach of an electrical outlet.  Then just clip the dryer body onto the plate, plug in, and DONE!<br /><br />The design's great, because the dryer can continue to cool, even after you hang it up, so you don't have to pre-cool it or worry about it overheating in its stand.  It has a nice little blueish-white nightlight built in, a pleasant plus.<br /><br />Would I buy it again?  Absolutely.  Do I recommend it?  Wholeheartedly for short haircuts.

It pulls hair like crazy. Everyone in the salon that borrows my dryer hates it too.

Neither of these things may be a problem for you. If you specifically WANT a retractable cord, the extra weight is worth it, otherwise, it's just extra weight.

It's easy to install, and handy as all get out. However, almost on its one-year birthday, the low setting stopped working, and within minutes it went from blowing on high regardless of the setting to becoming a fire hazard. The handgrip started heating up as I held it, and when I tried to turn it off, the switch was frozen completely and it continued to overheat even more. Since it had taken on a life of its own, I had to unplug the unit and un-install the whole thing. This is a great concept for a hairdryer--it can't be beaten for convenience while still being stowed out of the way when not in use. Granted, an appliance that retails for less than $30 can be expected to not last forever, but I've owned hand-held hairdryers that wouldn't quit for years and years.

The unit is a bit heavier than I expected, but the weight is balanced so handling is fine.  It's quieter than I expected even at full speed.  The cord is longer than needed in my personal situation, I find a cord that long just gets in the way.  The cord is straight, not coiled.  The big block thing at the end of the cord (vs. just an AC power plug) I find a nuisance since my power outlets are already GFCI-type outlets. Basic controls are fan & heat: 2 fan speeds + off & 2 temperatures + off.  The number of temperature settings advertized is a bit misleading - (&#34;4 temperatures&#34; is actually achieved by a combination of temperature switch & fan switch settings.)  Instructions (for English anyway) are generally lacking, but with a bit of experimentation one can figure out how to work it.  I rate the dryer 4 stars primarily for these reasons:  The &#34;Removeable stainless filter&#34; is a nice feature so hair clogs on the inlet can be removed, but getting it all back in place is not easy, it takes careful manipulation because the parts are not finely fitted and they bind easily (at least on my unit.)  Because of the binding and poor fit, I was afraid of breaking something in the precess of putting it back together after cleaning the filter.  The ad says: &#34;Includes concentrator&#34; - I assume this is supposed to be an attachment to put on the nozzle, my unit did NOT come with any extra parts.  All things considered I think it's overpriced and in some ways the ad is misleading.  I do intend to keep it, but will shop around again if I ever need another.",5/13/2013,3,3.0

I've used it almost every week since I bought it. I have a pixie haircut and I use it to sculpt & style my hair. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the switch there are about 4/5 different settings from cold shot to the highest setting of high. The switch is very poorly placed and u have to carefully switch it up or down or u would most likely end up breaking it.

I really liked the idea of a power cord that would retract into the unit, and honestly, that was a key point in choosing this over other models.  Well, the retracting mechanism worked perfectly once or twice.  After that, it would take 2-3 tries to get it to retract the cord all the way.  Usually, it would stop roughly mid-way.  After a couple months of that silliness, it now won't retract more than half way no matter how much you fuss with it.  This hair dryer was barely used at all before this bad behavior started.<br /><br />Do you remember those terrible roller window shades we had back in the 70's?  You know the ones.. they were ugly white and every time you tried to make the shade go up all the way, you'd struggle?  You'd pull it a tiny bit and hope it'd release the mechanism and pull up, but instead, it'd pull out a little more each time until finally you had that sucker pulled all the way down to the floor?  Well, if you enjoyed that nice nugget of frustration, please buy this hair dryer!<br /><br />Other observations:<br />- The release button is in an awkward position, so even when this was working, it was an awkward 2-handed affair.<br />- The noise seems a little less than a typical hair dryer.  But then again, the airflow seems a little less too.  Same goes for the heat.<br /><br />Honestly, I can't believe I took the time today to get online and review a silly hair dryer.

So now I had a criteria for research:  Something that was quiet and didn't blow my hair into a limp state.  That's what lead me to this Remington.  It shipped and got here quickly.  Yes, it smelled a bit funny as all new hair appliances do when first used, but I was impressed.  It was easy to handle.  I liked that I didn't have to keep sliding buttons up and down to change settings like my old hair dryer.  It was relatively quiet as hair dryers go.  The drying process went very quickly.

Unless you really want a cord-keeper dryer or have already chosen the ~$30 price point, I might look around more before settling on this one. However, it does the job and I'm going to keep it. Personally, I wish I hadn't been so desperate and had spent a little more time looking, but I'm also willing to spend a little (or a lot) more money for something I won't want to replace later.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* cord-keeper - no tangled cords!<br />* good wattage - fast dry<br />* tourmaline does soften hair - noticeable, but subtle<br /><br />Cons:<br />* heavy - I like to hold the dryer vertically above my head and it's significantly heavier than a non-tourmaline.<br />* large - this is above average in size, don't think you're going to travel with it.<br /><br />Some low-star reviewers mentioned the finish coming off on their hands, and I'd just like to clarify that is a random flaw in their dryers. I have porcelain skin and use this on the highest setting for about 20-30 minutes and have not seen any finish come off - so if you're worried about that, it's not the norm.<br /><br />As far as this being a tourmaline dryer, it's an upgrade from non-tourmaline; the technology used dries the water on your hair and you should see less heat damage.

This is the same socket I've used for several different curling wands, straighteners, hair dryers, battery chargers and even Glad plug-ins over the last eight years. The plugs on all those items fit the outlet just fine. The plug on this dryer will fall right out of the socket six or seven times in the five or six minutes it takes to dry my hair. VERY frustrating! I usually sit a heavy book about 8 inches out on the cord to hold it steady then shove a vase against the plug to keep it in the socket. Of course, this leaves very little cord length for raising the dryer up to my head since the cord is already a bit short.",4/11/2013,3,3.0

You have one button to push to turn it on and then when you're done, just put the dryer back into its holder and it automatically turns off. Its easy to clean, and easy to change the wattage setting. I mounted it near my mirror and the nightlight which I thought would not be a good thing, turns out to be so perfect in the middle of the night.

R3OFQC9UNF4UWB,52843051,568981338,4,5,N,True,5,Fifth failure of same feature (LOW setting fails),"Update: I purchased my latest replacement (yes, if you buy this product you will need to replace it regularly) on Jun 19, 2017 and now it has failed on July 27 (LOW speed stopped working so it only blows on HIGH). The product is wonderful when it works but my Amazon order history shows it is a consistent failure (purchases on Jan 3, 2012, Mar 5, 2013, May 20, 2013, Jun 19, 2017) of the same feature. There was at least one other failure but I complained directly to the manufacturer about the short lifespan in 2013 and was sent a new one and also bought another new one at a local store and these two lasted 4 years, 2013-2017.<br /><br />Some people may ask why I keep buying this product and I will say, 1) it is inexpensive, 2) a few of these units have lasted for more than one year, 3) the 3 holes on my bathroom wall where it is mounted are difficult to disguise and each replacement unit so far has fit into these holes (although I now use a slightly larger drywall anchor) and, 4) I like having a hair dryer off my counter!<br /><br />Original comment: I purchased this hair dryer more than a year ago and used it nearly every day to dry both my husband's and my own short hair.  It is a reasonably quiet but powerful machine that does its job well.  The addition of a hanger on the wall mount to wrap the cord out of harms way, since it inevitably stretches out, is a great innovation.  I would have given it a 5-star review then.<br /><br />Unfortunately the lower speed (it has two speeds) stopped functioning after a little more than a year. The higher speed is too hot and too noisy to use.  I repurchased the exact same hair dryer on April 6, 2013.  Today--3 days AFTER the 30-day product replacement window--the lower speed stopped functioning.<br /><br />Updated 7/14/15:  The manufacturer replaced this hair dryer under their more customer-friendly policy but I had already bought a new one from Amazon so I stored it away.  Last week, more than two YEARS later, the new Amazon hair dryer quit (same reasons as before) and I was able to install the stored dryer in 10 minutes.  I urge Amazon customers to always consider invoking the manufacturer's warranty and remind everyone that being able to reprint the Amazon purchase record provides &#34;proof of purchase&#34; they needed to honor their own 1-year warranty.  I also  am upgrading this product to 4 stars because it continued to perform well for longer than many inexpensive electrical appliances these days and, obviously, I like the style and functionality enough to keep buying the same unit<br />I won't purchase a third one.  I downgraded my review to 3 stars because, when functioning correctly, it is still a very decent hair dryer.  The company needs to work on their quality control issues.air dryer quit (same reasons as before) and I was able to install the stored dryer in 10 minutes.

Both of these hair dryers are made by Helen of Troy. Both have the same handle, body, and heat/speed options.  Both have the exact same Intertek number (3175842).

I didn't give it a 5/5 because I'm not quite raving--it didn't transform my hair, like some people claimed, or dramatically reduce my drying time, but for the price, this hairdryer is a great value and I think I'll be using mine for quite some time to come.<br /><br />I've owned this hairdryer for about a month now. Here are my impressions:<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Doesn't get as hot, but dries my hair in about the same amount of time as my old (non-ceramic, non-ionic) hairdryer (if anything, a little faster). Lower heat is less damaging to my hair, so since this dryer still gets it done just as quickly, that's a good thing in my book!<br />- Has three heat settings and two intensity settings, allowing for lots of control.<br />- Has a cold shot button that functions well.<br />- Retractable cord is very convenient for traveling and storage.<br />- Design is sleek and attractive.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- I wish the cord were just a little longer. Maybe I'm asking for too much, but this one seems a little shorter than my last, and I find myself pulling on it fairly often.<br />- The hairdryer is a bit heavy, but nothing unmanageable. Get that arm workout!<br /><br />I haven't used the diffuser or concentrator attachments, so I can't give an accurate review of those.

Conair dryer that she loved.  She figured sticking with Conair would be a safe bet, given how long her mini travel dryer had lasted.  WRONG.  She had this one less than a year before the plug box started repeatedly shorting out whenever it was plugged in.  (We've never had any problems with other appliances plugged into the same outlet, including other hairdryers).  Ultimately, the plug box started smoking from the repeated shorts whenever the prongs touched outlet.  She just had to toss it and will have to buy another one far sooner than she expected she'd have to.  Conair should make better quality products than this!",4/5/2013,5,3.0

I'm very happy to have purchased it as it has changed the texture of my hair tremendously. I never knew how much a blow dryer can have such an effect to the results of your hair. My hair is so smooth, soft, and shiny. I use to dread blow drying my hair and instead forfeited it altogether. I would only blow dry on special occasions and preferred air drying because I have very long and thick hair so it would take my full hair to dry 30-45 minutes and even then there would be spots still damp, my hair would get caught in the vent, it was EXTREMELY hot under the blow dryer....basically it was more of a hassle to blow dry my hair. With the T3 it is so pleasant and 10 times quicker to dry. I love the efficiency and ease the T3 provides as well as the amazing results.<br /><br />I had my mother try my dryer out so she could feel the difference and she was instantly converted. She commented she never knew that a blow dryer could make such a difference. [We are use to buying cheaper dryers because we didn't think a more expensive dryer made a difference.] This is a great investment and what a deal you get from purchasing on Amazon. I see the T3 dryers on sale at TJ Maxx periodically but it is still no way near the deal I got on Amazon.

R2JCBNQ2Z0XTWH,32020305,734632472,5,5,N,True,8,Great little T3 dryer,"I have full size T3 for the home, and I wanted a compact T3 for travel (because no one wants to have a bad hair-day on vacation; think of the pictures!) I need a decent dryer to handle my long hair. Hotel dryers are always pretty cheap, and my old mini travel was useless. T3 travel dryer is pretty comparable to the full size. You still get fairly fast dry times, softer hair, no frizz, and more volume. The only difference between the Travel and Full size is that the Travel drying times are a bit longer. It also comes with a little travel pouch, as an added bonus.<br /><br />You can certainly get away with buying the travel dryer for home use to save money over the regular one (which normally runs $200, and you really have to wait out the sales). It works better than a typical semi-professional dryer in the same price range (works better than my old Tool Science dryer, which was about $60).<br /><br />My favorite thing about the T3s is that they can actually handle restyling my hair when it's already dry (none of my old dryers could ever do this; I had to spray water in my hair and re-dry).<br /><br />Another review mentioned the drier did not have a serial number on the nozzle. This was not my experience. My dryer had the sticker with the serial number under the nozzle (look for a clear label that says DANGER). I highly recommend registering your product on the T3 website.

They will replace, but it costs money. For me it was $40 plus another $15 to ship. Absurd! They said even doing so was against their rules because Amazon was not an authorized dealer. Well, long story short, the manufacturer (T3) wanted $55 to replace. Amazon, knowing this is a poor business practice, stood behind their service and refunded the entire purchase price.

R1V1NK3HZ7G1CQ,41831271,453645026,5,23,N,False,24,It's a good dryer,"I have been researching hair dryers and came upon this dryer which my mother owns (and I still borrow).  I'm looking to buy my own for convenience. My mother originally bought this dryer because it was used in a lot of Dominican salons and the fact that she's had it over 10 years I think speaks for itself. We didn't buy it on Amazon but, at a local beauty supply for about $60 then.  I wanted to leave a review because I felt that a lot of reviews I've seen for different dryers were left by people with hair types that could be dried well even without a hair dryer. Not so for me.<br /><br />My hair:<br />- Thick<br />- Coarse<br />- Long (past the middle of my back)<br />- Dominican (if that helps)<br />- Cannot air dry it (it would dry very puffy and frizzy if so)<br />- Has been relaxed (I relax it 2-4 times a year)<br />- Retains water (humid weather wreaks havoc)<br /><br />What seems to be most people's hair types in hair dryer reviews overall (not just this one):<br />- Able to dry with minimal effort (no brushing or able to point the dryer generally and have their hair still dry straight)<br />- Hair that can dry in 5-20 minutes with minimal effort<br />- Thick (though I think some people are confused as to their actual hair type)<br /><br />I was surprised to learn that this hair dryer is only 1300 watts. After reading many dryer reviews, I thought I'd need something that was 2000 watts. Now, I'm rethinking that because this still does a good job at 1300. I think some people who leave dryer reviews don't know their actual hair type and/or how to properly blow dry their hair for a smooth, lasting, straight finish. Sometimes it's not the dryer's fault but, HOW people attempt to dry their hair. My mother does hair very well (if you've ever gone to a Dominican salon, you know that Dominican salons tend to do hair well). Some people at other salons tend to dry all hair types as if they are the same and dry the same and that isn't the case, leaving me (or others Iknow with similar hair) with terrible results. These have been my experiences and obviously don't apply to everyone. I don't like going to salons and haven't gone in years. Using this dryer, I have always received compliments on how nice and straight my hair looks.<br /><br />When I first tried to do my own hair (without really knowing how to) using someone's John Frieda 1875 watt hair dryer. I did a horrible job that took me a very long time and ended with puffy hair, not smooth at all but at least dry. If you don't use a blow dryer on a hot enough setting, it will not dry well, it only gets the water out of your hair is all. My mother, using the same dryer, did a much better job similar to the results with this dryer.  You have to use a brush of some type (round or straight) to pull and straighten the hair for a smooth finish.  You should also dry only small sections at a time for better results and always point the dryer down and in the direction of the hair shaft using the concentrator nozzle. I use a thermal protector as well as other products for shine so, I can't comment on the dryer's efficacy on those things.<br /><br />PROS about this dryer:<br />- Takes my hair only about 40 minutes to fully dry (after just squeezing out excess water with a towel, parting, clipping and drying small sections at a time. Compare this to salons where I have to sit under a hooded dryer for well over an hour and have them still blow dry my hair straight after, which takes another 20 minutes or so for a total of almost two hours.)<br />- Dries smoothly and straightens well (no need to use a flat iron after)<br />- Gets very hot<br />- Strong air flow<br />- Good weight (not too heavy)<br />- Buttons are well placed (don't accidentally press anything)<br />- Long cord length (Haven't measured it exactly but, it is at least 6 feet, probably more and has never been an issue)<br />- Removable filter (can easily clean for a longer life)<br />- Durable (has been owned for at least 10years and still works well, using it several times a week on 2-3 people with similar hair types to my own)<br />- Comes with a concentrator nozzle (Stays put and after years of accidental drops has never broken)<br />- Could go for up to a week without having to redo hair<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Brand name rubbed off after many years (I don't care but, may be a con for some)<br />- Gets very hot (have to protect my ears sometimes and cannot leave it close to my scalp for long. Good that it gets that hot but, you have to be careful so it's a pro and con)<br />- Loud (I think most dryers are. In terms of hearing conservation, I would recommend using ear plugs with dryers since they are so close to your head/ears and are very loud for a long period of time. This could eventually result in some amount of noise-induced hearing loss. Not specifically with just this dryer but, any dryer.)<br />- Only has a hot and cool setting (each with different strengths. The cool setting isn't that cool, it is warm although I've only used it after using hot for over 30 minutes. This is only a con if you're looking for a dryer with a cool shot.)<br />- Somewhat expensive (there are many dryers available for half this price so it is an investment)<br />- Not compact (If you're looking for something like that. I have had bad experiences with hotel dryers that leave my hair a big puffy mess so I will still pack and use this, even though it is a full size hair dryer. It's that good.)<br /><br />I would recommend this product but, I am not personally buying it for myself because it is over my budget. I am looking for a dryer that is less than $40-50 and available through prime. This dryer is not available with prime shipping and the beauty supply store has jacked up the price over the years. If you can afford to spend that amount on a dryer, it is a good investment. I'd prefer not to if I can find something that works as well as this one for less money. If I do find something like that, I will definitely share that (I'm researching and will try) but, at least I have this dryer as a backup if anything.",3/29/2013,5,5.0

It is delicate; I keep it in the box and put it away as soon as I'm done, which is 10-12 minutes.  If it is dropped, the tourmaline technology can be damaged and will not work.

It's very pretty. I dig the red.  It took a couple days to get used to holding it as it's a bit bulky. But to be fair my other one had a shorter nozzel and was lighter.  The placement of the setting switches is not optimal. I can't easily switch from low to high and back to low without looking at what I'm doing.  And the hot setting is not very hot. Which, I guess, my hair is thankful for.  But boy does she have great blowing power! It's like being in a wind tunnel. My hair dries in half the time now which is great!  I have used both attachments that came along with it too. I was afraid due to the force of the blowing it would blow those little gadgets right off and smack me upside the head but they stayed put.  The blow dryer is a little louder than I am used to but not a big deal.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with the product. I can overcome the negatives. Hope it lasts!<br /><br />_________________<br /><br />REVIEW EDITED SEPT 2013 =  And there she blows...out!  The heating element died already.

Unfortunatley, since I had that thing for 7-8 years, they don't appear to make the EXACT same model, but this one comes pretty close.<br /><br />What I like:<br />- Comfortable to hold - the proportion and shape of the the handle are excellent<br />- Lightweight - so your arm won't get tired holding it<br />- 3 heat settings - and the &#34;very hot&#34; is actually hot enough<br />- Price - under $20!<br />- Color - my old one was grey, but this red is kinda sassy!<br /><br />What disappointed me:<br />- Speed - the highest speed is adequate, but it's not as fast as my old Vidal Sasson hair dryer (RIP, old friend)<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this to anyone who needs a basic hair dryer for not a lot of money, and if past experience can be repeated, this thing could last you a good half decade or more, depending on how often you knock yours off the bathroom counter.",3/26/2013,4,4.0

I knew when I bought it that it wasn't silent.<br /><br />It works great - warms up fast and the attachment it comes with helps me direct the air, so I'm not putting air where I don't want it and making my hair poofy.  I like that it has separate switches for temp and how fast the air is coming out.  The controls are side -by- side on the handle.  On the handle there is the option for warm and hot, and the one next to it has low and high.  There is a cool button on the back up by the mesh (when pressing this, it takes about 2 seconds for it to blow cool) - and on the side of the barrel there is the option for turbo on and turbo off - this gives 4 speeds of air flow.<br /><br />Just make sure the handle is all the way up, otherwise it will start to fold down on you. It does sort of catch in two places, so it won't close on your hand - there is also an inch and a half/two inch gap, so it's impossible to hurt your hand.

R2DK2XPRVGY4MV,52510083,107341965,5,17,N,True,17,"If You Want Silky, Soft, Frizzless Hair...","I've only had this blow dryer for 3 or 4 days, but I already love it. The older one I was using was more than 20 years old and the difference is amazing. I have no idea if the tourmaline or any of the rest of it mean anything, but the difference between this dryer and my old one was great. My old dryer would almost burn my scalp and had only two settings high/hot and low/low. After drying my hair with this new dryer, my hair was silky and soft and, yes, no frizz. It also dried my hair very fast. I used the high speed with medium heat and it was perfect for the drying, then I turned it down to low heat and speed for styling.<br /><br />This dryer has separate buttons for heat and speed. I spent a lot of time staring at the picture that was on this page and could not tell if there were two buttons or just one, so I wanted to mention that, and I uploaded some pictures of the buttons as well. The buttons are next to each other on the handle, on the inside where your fingers grip. The sliding buttons are not easily moved, so it's not likely that you would slide them unintentionally while drying your hair.<br /><br />I ordered and received this blow dryer from Amazon.com, but the dryer they sent me was slightly different from the one pictured here. It looks almost exactly like this one, but the silver design on the side is smooth and it says you on it instead of infiniti and doesn't say Conair underneath, though it does say Conair on the nozzle part of the dryer. Other than that, the dryer they sent me is the same as this one: same specs, same buttons, same cord, so perhaps it's just a newer version of this dryer and the photo is outdated. The dryer I received also looks darker than the one in the picture, but it's a sparkly dark teal that looks very pretty.<br /><br />I'm very pleased with this dryer and recommend it. Before purchasing, I saw the reviews of some that said it didn't last long, but I decided to order it anyway, since I didn't find another I liked better than this one. Only time will tell how long it will last, but for now, I'm very pleased.<br /><br />04/10/2013 UPDATE: I wrote this review when I'd only had the blow dryer for a few days, so I wanted to do a quick update. This blow dryer is still great. I love it. My hair has never looked better after blow dryer. I still have the same little quibble that I had before, though: the little tie that is attached to the cord is just much too short. It makes folding up the cord a pain. I have to put my glasses on and struggle with it for several minutes. I have a hand mixer with the exact same type of tie on it. It's just a little longer than this one and it's so easy to attach it. If they'd made this one even a half inch longer, it would have been so easy to use. I will probably try to find some alternative to keep the cord folded up, but they really should have just put one on that was long enough.<br /><br />Even so, the blow dryer is great. I love having different speeds and heat levels. Also, the hottest setting doesn't burn my scalp.etter than this one.

It was not around any water! My hair was dry and was using it to help make it straighter. At first it had a smokey smell and I thought maybe this is like a new hair dryer smell. My straightener sometimes smells like this if I use with my hair wet so I thought this was fine. I turned it out waited 5 mins then tried again and luckily I cautiously turned the hair dryer away from hair to make sure it was safe and sure enough fire came out I turned it off unplugged it and it patted it down with a blanket till I stopped.

My ass can prove it.<br />So, we needed a new hair dryer for the changing table (we dry off our baby after we use wet wipes on her butt, and after she gets a bath), and we had to have one that was fast and could have a &#34;just warm&#34; setting. This one is so good that I find myself walking from one end of the house to the other in the morning to dry my own hair at the changing table. Without a mirror, no less. It's that good. So I just need to get a second one now because I can't keep this extra activity up.<br />Oh, and it's loud (I don't know how they'd make one that isn't), but I love the 4 settings (cool slow, warm fast, hot slow, and hotter fast) and it dries my hair in half the time as my old crappy one does. Even though it has the same wattage.<br />I also like the fact that it's white.

I needed to purchase a new one quickly, saw this one in a local store, and picked it up.<br /><br />This dryer has several very nice features.  First, it has three HEAT settings (hot, warm, cool) PLUS two STRENGTH settings (low and high).  In addition, you have the option of boost the air flow with the turbo button and also using the cool shot button to set your style.  I have found that what works best for me is to mostly dry my hair on the high heat-high power setting, then go down to the low power for a minute or two of styling.  Using this method, I am able to complete my overall drying time significantly more quickly than with my old hair dryer.  This dryer's nozzle is a bit longer than that of my old dryer, meaning that I bumped my head the first few times I used it, but I quickly got used to this.  For a larger dryer, I find it to be relatively lightweight and relatively quiet as well.<br /><br />Another feature of this dryer is the removable back to allow you to clean the lint screen; although I was attracted to this concept, I am unable to get the back off!  Perhaps we just have a dud, but it simply does not move.  Also, I should mention that the attachment is HUGE.  I hadn't really planned on using it anyway, but when I did try to snap it on to the dryer, I could not get it on easily.<br /><br />Overall, I have have been quite happy with this hair dryer--I just wish the back would come off.  My final rating is 4 1/2 stars.<br /><br />Edited 4/1/13:  Good news--I was able to get the back off this morning!  It seems like it just suddenly came unstuck when I tried it again (after many tries).

That had been the best hair dryer I had owned, and the American market doesn't have any (nothing of the same quality at least) as the one I'd had. So after a good nearly 10 years, the Tescom retired itself and I needed a replacement. I did a search for the same brand and several Panasonics came up. Panasonic in Japan makes great quality products so after a little searching and looking through reviews I ordered this model - mainly because of the adjustable styling brush AND it was dual voltage (I'd hate to have to get a voltage converter for something that is everyday use). This hair dryer is way better than the one I'd had for so long and I love it! Great for styling my bangs and giving my layers a little bit of body and slight curl at the ends.

R3MRPT1LO1VTG,10733622,415529274,2,4,N,False,5,Overheats every now and then! Don't buy!,"I purchased this dryer before a trip to India. I used it for a couple of weeks in the US at the 120 V setting and then for about 4 weeks in India at the 230 V setting. It seemed to be working fine and I was happy.<br /><br />However when I came back to US and reset the voltage to 120V, that's when the thing started acting up. It was way too noisy, overheated so much that it stopped working all together!! Well, at that time my hair was about half dried and straightened, with the other half wet and beginning to curl... So I had no option but to somehow get this thing working again! I reset it, gave it a few minutes to cool down and tried again on the low heat setting... It was ok and I completed drying my hair..<br /><br />The next time I used it, alternating between high and low heat, it seemed to be fine... The time after that, it overheated again and I finally gave up on it... Its no use investing even $20 in this piece... It has only 2 heat settings without a cold shot button, doesn't work consistently every time... And if you change the voltage settings, it doesn't work properly! Cheap piece, do not invest any time and money in this!!!",1/30/2013,1,1.0

When it arrived, it was not as large as I thought it would be...that's a good thing when you're tight on storage space. I would say this is a mid-size hairdryer. Not the full gigantic salon-sized version nor the mini travel version. It doesn't seem too noisy when on and the volume of air it blows is pretty decent.<br /><br />The overall construction is as you would expect for the price...a glossy smooth plastic outer shell surrounding the internal heating/electrical/mechanical workings. The switch is easy to manipulate into the desired setting: down for low and up for high. The cool shot button allows the hairdryer to ramp up into the high mode but blow out cool air. The filter cover on the end of the hairdryer is easy to remove by twisting off. I prefer this type of filter cover over the hinged version that you cannot run under the sink for a good cleaning. If you ever rinse the filter cover, make sure it is absolutely dry before putting it back on the hairdryer as water and electricity do not mix! On the topic of electricity, the hairdryer also features a GFCI plug in case your bathroom doesn't have a GFCI outlet. This feature trips the power off to your hairdryer in case it comes into contact with water, preventing electrocution.<br /><br />The weight is decent and lightweight, not too heavy to hold while drying your hair. The handle could be a bit more comfortable, but for the money I cannot complain that much.<br /><br />I don't know about durability, but I think it was a decent purchase and very utilitarian.",1/26/2013,4,4.0

My only complaint is regarding the length of the nozzle. They call it the &#34;concentrator&#34; attachment. When I am styling my bangs or blowing out my hair with a round brush - it makes the dryer too close to my head / hair and it makes styling more difficult.  My last hair dryer's attachment was longer with an air flow vent - to keep the air from blasting you in the head. I guess this will take some getting used to.

I would think a man's hair dryer would have 2 settings: Off and On.  This one has a combination of settings and I have no idea what their purposes are.  It will blow air of varying heats at varying speeds, if that appeals to you.  I tend to just use hot and high.  I'm not real sure about the ions but it all sounds very scientific so I just leave that on.<br /><br />At any rate, I've had it for a couple of months now and have had no problems with it.  It really does blast the heat, and air too, so drying is pretty quick.  The little detachable nozzle is nice too, as leaving it on focuses the air better, but I took it off once when I need to work some duckback oilskin treatment into my oilskin coat (no, really).  This calls for a more even application of heat so the ability to remove the nozzle was actually handy.<br /><br />Overall I can't imagine how it could be better.<br /><br />I suppose it could dispense donuts but I can't really dock them a star for that oversight, I guess.",1/15/2013,5,5.0

From reading the specs and reviews on this Andis 82005 dryer, I felt this one fit the bill. But after using it for a week, I have mixed feelings. Here is why:<br /><br />PROS:<br />1. Sleek looking (so what? Nice, but doesn't make your hair look any nicer)<br />2. Nice variety of attachments that stay attached nicely!<br />3. Long 10 ft. cord (if you need that, however I don't, and it really only gets in the way)<br />4. Hang loop<br />5. Dries hair fairly quickly (with Ion technology)<br />6. Outside stays cool to touch<br /><br />CONS:<br />1. Heavier than the last two dryers we've had (Hot Tools Tourmaline Lite 1043 --- see my review on that one, and CHI low-EMF dryer).<br />2. Dries hair no faster than the two abovementioned ionic dryers<br />3. NOT quiet (in fact, louder than the two abovementioned dryers!)<br />4. Not enough speed/heat settings. Not much difference in heat settings, although speed settings are adequate.<br />5. Comb attachment actually hurts your scalp! Feels very scratchy, due to squared ends of the teeth.<br />6. Shiny silver-colored exterior shows prints, etc. much more than others.<br /><br />All in all, not a bad dryer... I guess I expected more.

After trying unsuccessfully to get her to unplug it and put it away, I realized her life would be a whole lot easier if I just got her a wall mount hair dryer and deliberately mount it next to where she stands in front of the sink rather than mount it right next to the sink itself.  That solves a lot of problems: she doesn't have to use up drawer space for the dryer, I don't have to worry about her putting it away hot, it is always plugged in and ready, the coil cord never drags over the sink (so nothing getting knocked off the sink), and of course the risk of the dryer falling into the sink is practically eliminated.<br /><br />This hair dryer is conveniently small so it's easy to handle, even for a young teen with long hair.  It dries hair quickly because it is powerful despite its size.<br /><br />Wall mounting was trivially simple -- it took less than five minutes with my hand dandy drill/driver, bits, level, and a hand screwdriver (it is much better to use a manual screwdriver instead of a drill/driver to screw into wall anchors).

R14QFX5FFN3IKQ,51328489,47684938,4,1,N,True,1,It is huge,"Wow, it is huge ... and not just huge for a &#34;portable&#34; ... I mean huge.  Now maybe it's because this baby is an 1875 watt job and all our other current and prior hair dryers are 1600 or less.  When it is open, it is bigger than any other hair dryer we have ever owned.  When it is closed (folded, for &#34;travel&#34; -- heh, like this would handily fit in a suitcase) this thing is almost as big as my dopp (shaving bag).  Fortunately we travel more by ground so we don't worry much about suitcase space.<br /><br />And, as others have mentioned, the cord does not reel in all the way without help or retries.  We can live with that.  Even once the cord is stored, the cordstop leaves about a foot of cord out.  It wasn't a surprise because other reviewers have mentioned this too.<br /><br />On the plus side it does dry hair quickly.  FYI, all the girls in our family have long thick hair.<br /><br />A very important feature this dryer has -- and a major reason I chose it -- is that it does have a &#34;medium&#34; heat setting.  (Most just have high and low, with low being very low.)  The reason &#34;medium&#34; is important, especially on a high wattage unit, is that &#34;high&#34; can blow circuit breakers.  If you don't whether you have 20amp service on an outlet, you may really want the medium setting.  (Ever try to get a hotel to reset your breaker while your wife's hair is wet?)  The &#34;medium&#34; setting dries hair just fine.  The high setting dries hair scary fast, but I'm not sure how good that much heat is for your hair in the long run, but it is nice to have when you're in a hurry.<br /><br />A word of advice about any high wattage appliance with a cord reel:  always pull the cord all the way out regardless of how much you need.  I don't know if it tells you that in the manual but it's always a good idea because a coiled cord carrying a lot of current will get hot.  From staring at this unit, it is possible the hair dryer draws the cold intake air across the cord reel so they might have thought of that already but I wouldn't rely on that.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a great hair dryer as long as you know before buying about its size and the price is certainly right.the cord reel so they might have thought of that already but I wouldn't rely on that.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a great hair dryer as long as you know before buying about its size and the price is certainly right.",12/22/2012,4,4.0

I have had several other mini dryers (both by Connair and by Revlon) but this is by far my favorite.  I've had it for four years and I hope to be able to use it for many more years to come!

I had been interested in the 'ions' I'd seen on many packages.  This is a very nice hair dryer, it came with both a diffuser and a concentrator which snap on nicely and work well, as designed.  It dries my hair very quickly even on the low setting, and I like how the intake is on the back rather than the sides and is less likely to draw longer hair into it.

And then it broke.  :(,"I bought this hair dryer from Target 4 months ago because it had the best reviews of all the ones they had there on the shelf.  In my house, we only use the hair dryer around 3 times a week total between my husband and myself (I only have to style my hair once every 4 days or so)... so this thing got minimal use.  When I bought it I was annoyed at how the temperature switch (to go from hot to cold) is in a spot on the handle where you usually grip the thing while you're drying.  I would constantly accidentally switch it to the cold setting.  And, I never felt like this got hot enough to style my thick, unruly hair.  My hair is crazy thick and I need a lot of heat to get the frizz out while I'm drying and styling... but I've had to deal with this and hair dryers not being hot enough my whole life, so this wasn't a huge surprise.  But then, a few days ago the heat function just completely broke.  So, now it only blows cool air no matter what.. which makes it basically useless to me.

The concentrator attachment is good. Every hair dryer needs one. The diffuser is scary haha! I have no idea what to do with it but whatever. It is apparently for creating volume, but I have thick, short asian hair so I don't need any extra volume. Cord length is fine. The back opens up really easily for cleaning. The cool button and cool heat function are ACTUALLY cool. Most hairdryers take time to cool down, so going from hot to cold doesn't work. However, on this hairdryer, if you want to go straight from hot to cool, it happens in seconds. maybe it's just because it has cooled down here in san diego but I can't really definitively determine that. Anyways great hairdryer! :)",11/24/2012,5,5.0

There are cheaper models, but this one is very well made and we have every reason to expect the longevity other reviewers have noted. I use the low setting (I used to use high on my old one) and it works beautifully and is much quieter. The cord retractor is great; at first I expected this to be just a marketing gimmick, but now I wouldn't buy a dryer without one. Very nice to pull the cord in and drop the dryer in a drawer without having to roll up the cord first, and then untangle it whenever you take it out. We ended up buying two of these to prevent my daughter from swiping it and having to search. Nice to find a product that is well made and reasonably priced.

I bought it because it had high reviews and a great price. With a solid 4 star review, I expected a lot more from this dryer.<br /><br />The issue about this dryer that bothers me the most is the air flow. When you turn it on, it sounds like those cheap kid toys with a wind motor. Then it warms up a bit and you get used to the cheap motor and you dry your hair. It doesn't have enough air force! I mean, it's a standard blow dryer so yes it has good air flow. But I expected something a lot more impressive from the reviews given.<br /><br />On a plus side, it does have good heat.<br /><br />I also thought that the air flow would be solved with that front clamp thingy (the front thingy that pushes the air flow in a very specific direction) but NO! Actually the air feels more dispersed with the front clamp thing. Wha??<br /><br />I guess this comes down to the fact that you get what you pay for. But sometimes I have paid very little and have gotten a whole lot.

The product dries my hair OK but I can't see any difference in the time it takes compared to my old blow dryer.  The things I don't like about it are:<br />1.  It's really big.  I had to reorganize my bathroom because it wouldn't fit in the drawer my old blow dryer occupied.<br />2.  It's really big (again) - I have small hands so it's uncomfortable and unwieldy to hold and operate.  One small plus is that, although it's huge it's thankfully not very heavy.<br />3.  Watch out for the buttons!  They are placed on the handle in a way that allows you to accidentally turn the hair dryer off, change the drying speed or the temperature while you are trying to dry your hair.  Since this just happened AGAIN to me I decided to write this review!  It's uncomfortable to try and hold a huge hair dryer while having to constantly watch the position of your hand on the handle where the buttons are located so as not to change a setting while operating.<br />I'll keep this because it's easier than returning it but if I had it to do over again I would not purchase this particular hair dryer.",11/19/2012,2,2.0

Though it look sturdy and well made, my Conair 207P Infinity Tourmaline Ceramic Hair Dryer dries my hair way faster than the Solano 3500. I was going to exchange it with the Solano 3700 but it wasn't on sale and I don't want to pay $200 dollars for a hair dryer. I was hesitant to try the Sedu 4000i because of some negative reviews but I thought worst case scenario I can return it if I end up not liking it. Sedu 4000i is really small compared to other pro hair dryer. It look sturdy , has a sleek look and weighs 1.2 lbs, weighed not including the cord. Hair dryer's length is 5 3/4 inches ( without the concentrator ) , depth 2 3/4 inches, height ( from top of the dryer to the bottom of the handle ) 7 3/4 inches. Solano 3500 though much bigger than Sedu 4000i just weigh 1 pound. First time I used the Sedu 4000i I was so impressed. It dried my hair way faster ( took only 10 minutes ) than my 4 yr old Conair that burns my hair sometimes. I have long ( mid back ) hair. Medium thickness with some wave and I don't like to use flat iron or any kind of hair products on my hair. ( except shampoo and conditioner ). Sedu is also quieter than my old Conair and Solano 3500. With Sedu 4000i my hair looks so shiny, straight and frizz-free. I keep the ion switch off on my hair dryer because I want some body/volume on my hair.

That is not a long time to evaluate it thoroughly, but it has been excellent so far.  Due to the retractable cord feature the barrel is a little fatter than other hair dryers that I have tried, but so far it is better than any other dryer I have used!  I think that if you use reasonable care when retracting the cord (like running the cord through your fingers as it retracts, to slow it down and straighten out any twists), it should last a long time.  I think that letting the cord zoom up at full speed, like I have inadvertently done twice, might shorten the Cord Retraction devices life (as some reviewers have reported).

As part of my transition to the civilian world, I have decided to grow out my hair because, in my mind, I believe I will one day look as stylish and sexy as Leonardo Decaprio. I am finding, though, that to achieve that look there is a lot involved including blow drying your hair. Not just for style but functionality as walking around all morning with wet hair is not fun.<br /><br />This ceramic hair dryer is amazing. It folds up saving space which is great since I am an organized O.C.D. son of a gun after so many years in the military. To add to the storage technique the cord conveniently retracts back into the main body of the blow dryer.<br /><br />This means that I can use the hair dryer both at the home and on the road as I do travel quite  a bit and find the hair dryers that come free in many hotel rooms leaving a lot to be desired.<br /><br />For its size, this hair dryer is also very powerful. I was surprised at both the amount of air it is able to blow as well as how hot it is capable of getting. It comes with a cool blast button which circulates regular room air. I use this setting when blowing hair off my neck after shaving it or after cutting my children's hair.<br /><br />Probably one of the biggest selling points, since I am a man, is the stylish grey/silver/black colors that feel manly in my hand versus the lime green and hot pink blow dryer my wife tried to get me to use the other morning.<br /><br />Overall, a very attractive and functional hair dryer that also has durability on its side.

This one has a powerful heating element (1875 watts), and a good fan (for its size). The purpose of a hair dryer is not to heat up the hair to boil away the water, but to speed up the evaporation process of drying by exposing the hair to a stream of hot air. The faster the stream and the warmer the air, the more evaporation occurs.  Where this dryer differs is in the body that has a longer and narrower nozzle that is about one inch wide. This forces a much stronger blast of air (at least on high speed) that is not a wide as those dryers with a wide nozzle.<br /><br />If your hair is fine, colored, permed or naturally curly, you would want a different dryer with a wider nozzle to diffuse the heat so that the hair dries more slowly at a cooler temperature. That may make the hair less likely to frizz and it may give the hair more volume.<br /><br />This dryer makes the nozzle narrow and thus helps to concentrate the heat into one spot in order to make the hair it blows on dry rapidly. You can adjust the fan speed and the temperature, but not the concentration of the air flow.<br /><br />So, if you have regular hair or (like me) are a guy that just wants to dry their hair rapidly, this is the dryer for you. Put it on high speed and high heat and it is extremely fast.",10/23/2012,3,4.0

It is almost impossible to buy 1600 W dryers now and even harder to find dryers than have the side mounted motors and fans which I like.  The new 1875 W dryers can cause circuit breakers to trip and I don't feel we need that much heat on our hair. We must all remember that in this economy everyone is trying to cut costs, and that pertains to hairdryers as well as everything else.  Anything we can do to reduce the shock to a new appliance can possibly lengthen the life of the product.

As described it has two blower speeds and two heat settings and that's it. The cord is a decent length without being too long or too short. If anything the high speed blower setting might be too fast, but it's not a big problem. However, I have had three of these , so read the updates.  Update#1: After  3 months the first one is still blowing and going. Came back and ordered another. Nothing but good things to say about this little hair dryer.  Update# 2: June 17, 2013: The first of two dryers I bought like this one stopped working today. It lasted about 10 months before the off/on switch smoked and went limp. It flops back and forth completely useless. Not as much of a bargain as I thought at first. But, I am ordering another and writing this bad switch off as bad luck. My 3rd one is on the way.  Update #3: In less than 4 months the second hair dryer quit. That is 2 of the three we own. I am not buying a fourth one.  Update #4: The third dryer has quit. Not one of the three lasted more than 10 months. It is not worth the hassle to return these cheap hair dryers. The cost of shipping both ways is more than buying a new one. Three hairdryers in just over a year all bought here on Amazon. The one I used the longest lasted 10 months. Andis is not a quality hair dryer in fact to me it is the definition of &#34;too cheap to be true&#34; junk.",8/9/2012,1,1.0
R2JBCS0Y514GC4,34188415,694290590,1,1,N,False,2,Not happy with this dryer,The biggest complaint I have about this dryer is that the buttons which are very sensitive are located exactly where your fingers go in order to hold it so I am constantly hitting them by mistake. To try to avoid that makes you hold the dryer in a very awkward manner. You would think they would notice when testing.  It is also heavy and bulky. I did not notice any additional shine to my hair.  The low setting is really cool and the hot is not very hot.  Takes a lot longer to dry my very short hair.  The only thing I did like was the hanging hoop. If I hadn't purchased it a long time ago as a back-up dryer I would return it.,8/8/2012,2,2.0

The other two have barely any room between the bristles, and so unless you have extremely short hair, you are not going to be able to run it through your hair. So you are left with the Boars hair brush. But that too, is pretty much useless, because the bristles are really long, and really weak, they don't get into your hair at all, rather they just skim over the top of it.

SENT THE WRONG PART AND WON'T SEND A REPLACEMENT!!!,"I am a hair stylist and I am about to open my own salon.  There is a lot of stress involved in opening your own business but receiving the CORRECT product should not be one of them.  I did my research and ordered through Amazon because noone had ever let me down when ordering through them.  Until now.  I ordered a portable hair dryer and waited patiently for it to be delivered.  When I received it, I opened the box and began putting it together.  One of the pieces did not fit so I just thought that maybe I was doing it wrong.  After myself, my landlord, AND a maintenance man tried to put it together, we all agreed that the wrong part was delivered and that I should call customer service to ask for a replacement.  After one email and two phone messages, I received a phone call back only to tell me that the manager said that the piece does fit and to try harder.  WHAT??!!  I tried so hard that I gashed my finger!  The customer service agent was very nice but had to relay this message to me from the manager.  So my question is...How in the world do you know if THIS piece actually fits?!  Is it possible that I received a faulty part?????  So now my only two choices are to go back and try to fit this piece in and possible hurt myself worse (it's a metal pole by the way) or send it back.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS COMPANY.

It works pretty quiet and has a low hum rather than the high pitched noise a lot of cheap-o hairdryers have. It doesn't shoot the air quite as fast and it doesn't get QUITE as hot as the $80 blowdryer my mom has, but it's pretty great at it's job because my hair actually looks better when I use this hairdryer vs the more expensive one. It definitely fights frizz very well.<br />The only problem I'd say I have with it is that it's a heavier dryer than my old one that broke.

I've always wanted a simple solution to great hair and this is exactly it. I used to own a Conair from the drug store and this Sedu has changed my perspective on hair dryers. I've always thought that I can never re-produce the kind of blow out that I get from salons but this hair dryer has made it possible. The air is pretty strong and I don't find the hair dryer heat up more than my drug store one. It does take most of the frizz away and my hair stays in a nice curve for the whole day when I use a round brush.<br /><br />To be fair though, this hair dryer more expensive so you would expect the higher quality to match the price tag. Another thing I found is that it's actually kinda heavy for its size. My old one is bigger but actually weight about the same as this one, maybe even less. If you are looking for a feather weight, maybe this is not for you. Other than that, I have no complaints.<br /><br />Loving it so far!",6/28/2012,5,5.0
R2BG3Y85LUDCJA,20504179,415529274,1,26,N,False,35,"light, easy to pack, and dual voltage but became a problem","I spotted this in the Target luggage section for about the same price and loved it at first sight and had to have it!!!!  It's the tiniest dryer I've ever seen!!!  It almost fits in the palm of my hand.  Folded, it's 4-5 inches long (not counting the cord).  I've been using it for about a week now just to test it out before my trip abroad and it's surprisingly very strong.  No weird smells as someone else mentioned- maybe their particular product has an issue.  So far mine is working great.  My hair is shorter so I'm not worried about how long it will take, but this thing is pretty strong.  I'm done in minutes.  The other great thing is that it has &#34;dual voltage.&#34;  I had to read up on this because I haven't traveled in a while and I guess a whole lot of electronics and stuff like this is made dual voltage today- so check your product and educate yourself.  Just look at this hair dryer, for example, and it will say 125V / 250V on the handle.  This means it will work anywhere where the voltage falls in that range... most if not all of the world. BUT YOU WILL NEED AN ADAPTER when going abroad with this.  So here is the tricky part if this stuff is new for you, too... you DON'T need a converter (more expensive) for anything that's dual voltage,  just an adapter.  The adapter is just the little plug part that goes into the wall so you can plug it in.  The converter is usually bigger and box-like and more expensive.  It converts the voltage. You can find adapters for just a few bucks.  Some dual voltage products have a little switch you have to bother with and it's dangerous if you forget to change that switch... no switch and no worries with this hair dryer!!  Just Google dual voltage and you can read up on it, and the difference between converter and adapter.  All these things are helpful to know when traveling abroad.  I love this thing... best thing I bought for travel recently since finding a hand-held luggage scale!  I originally jumped the gun and gave this5 stars.  Read my updates below.  12/20/12 Update:  This survived a trip to rural abroad and worked great, so long as I used it on low.  When I turned it on high it was like a crazy loud rocket ship and I thought it would take off or start fire- it was frightening!!!!  Yes, I did use my adapter, and it's possible it behaved this way because of the junkie old remote house with questionable wiring I was living in. Later I lived in a second, very modern house in the country's modern capital and it wouldn't plug into the wall at all in any part of the house!!  Yes, it was the right plug shape and I have no idea what that was about, again, the randomness is possibly the result of the house and the country I was in.  Who knows.  But I couldn't use it at all the last couple of months of my travels and that wasn't good.  I will continue to use it here at home in the USA where it works perfect.  Maybe better for local travel and still a great size if you have limited luggage space.  But I am changing my rating from 5 to 3 because the darn thing nearly gave me a heart attack the few times I accidentally put it on high while trying to turn it off.  I am still highly recommending this product for travel, but taking it abroad may be questionable.  1/15/13 UPDATE:  I barely started using it back home a month and the dang thing started making crazy noises and I thought it would explode or catch fire.  It basically went dead.  I tossed it in the garbage.  I am now changing my 3 star rating to 1 star.  I was wrong.  Turns out this was a piece of unreliable junk and potentially dangerous unreliable junk after all... didn't even last me a year.  And I barely used it!!!

Its performance was impressive for its size. As soon as I got home I ordered one. I found the included mounting kit (screws, 3M tape, dry wall anchors) a little flimsy. I used a better wall anchor to mount the dryer.<br /><br />All was well for 3 days. The hair dryer worked like a champ, until the third day when the on/off switch blew up in my hands. The switch had shorted out, causing a large poof of smoke/fire. This of course happened just after I had tossed the original packaging and Amazon shipping box. So I contacted the manufacture about a replacement. They were VERY interested in getting this dryer to the corporate offices ASAP. They sent out FedEx the next day to pick up the device to be sent back. I just received my replacement device, it took 15 days in total to receive it.<br /><br />I really hope this one lasts a bit longer.<br /><br />EDIT: I added photos to the product page showing how the switch blew up.",6/6/2012,3,3.0

Knowing that over the years there had been many an upgrade to hand-held blow-dryers, I spent about half a day reading through all the reviews on Amazon and checking out Consumer Reports (the latter being not much help in this area, I have to say).  This little jewel seemed to fit my needs:  quiet, light, multiple temperature selections and speeds, and a cool setting, too.  Plus, it had that fancy-shmancy ion stuff that's supposed to make your hair shine (although my thought on that was, yeah, right).  I have to admit, too, that I am partial to Conair as I have found that they last for YEARS and provide a nice powerful flow of air that helps me style my usually short hair.  Well, this new Conair 173RZ Ion Shine Ceramic Turbo hair dryer is now my new love.  It blows through my hair like a strong wind and the temperatures range from hot to cool with a perfect warm in-between (my usual setting).  The slide temp/power selection system is not my preference, as my thumb sometimes slips and I end up with the wrong setting for a second, but I am getting used to it.  It gets my hair dry in less than a minute.  While the dryer is not what I would call a whisper, it is not as loud as my previous Conair and for that I am thankful.  A nice little extra is that it folds in half at the top of the handle - great if you have storage issues.  But, the most surprising thing of all is that my hair actually DOES shine when I'm done!  I have salt and pepper hair and the salt gleams like sparkling silver threads afterwards.  What a treat!

I was fed up having cheap blow dryers that never lasted. I loved the blow dryer, it lasted me till a month ago. Guess the $110 I paid for it back then was worth the 6 years I got out of it. I was looking at buying the same one or at least a Chi blow dryer again, I just didn't want to spend the same amount of money, I was hoping to stay under $60. I did a bunch of research and saw that this blow dryer, T3 Featherweight, was on the list of best blow dryers the last few years and saw the price was close to what I wanted to pay and $30 cheaper than the Chi I had before. I also saw that it said it was a fast drying blow dryer like my old Chi, which I prefer since I have a ton of hair. After using it for over a week. I think it works pretty good.. not much difference from my Chi I had. It's lighter than my chi and it's made of some kind of plastic like material. It also looks solid white and black in the picture, but it's actually got some kind of silver pattern going on over the white which I'm not thrilled with, but it's not the reason I bought the blow dryer so I'll get over it. Seems to take about the same amount of time to blow dry my hair as the chi, maybe a little faster. I usually take about 8-15 minutes to blow dry my hair depending on how detailed i get with it, like I said I have a ton of hair. (thick Mid-back length hair)<br /><br />Why I give this a 4 instead of a 5, I prefer my Chi a little more, maybe it's the solid feel of it.

That being said, this is the best hairdryer I have ever used. Don't ask me to explain what that Ionic setting does---the manufacturer doesn't even explain it to my satisfaction. But, somehow, it DOES WORK on my cobweb-fine, delicate, difficult, body-less, totally straight, almost-waist-length hair. I wear it long and braided so I can ignore it as much as possible, and so it doesn't fly around all the time and get tangled in stuff or end up in people's food.  I only wash it once a week because it's so darn dry---it would probably all fall out if I washed it every day. I don't perm, color, or otherwise mess with it because chemicals just destroy it. I've had the split ends of my braid knot up so badly in the wind that I've had to cut an inch or more off. Most hairdryers are really hard on my hair, so I use them as little as possible.<br /><br />I like the design of this hairdryer---it's fairly light, comfortable to hold, and the attachment nozzle is nice for focusing the air where I want it. There's nowhere my hair can fly into the works and get tangled. I use the ionic setting with the heat on high, and control the amount of hot air with the handy cool burst blue button that turns the heat off. My hair dries faster and untangles easier than it ever has in my life. Not only that, but it STAYS untangled all week. How is this possible? I don't know. I DON'T CARE!<br /><br />I thought maybe I was imagining all this, so I asked my daughter-in-law to try it. She said, That was the best experience I've ever had with any hairdryer in my whole life.<br /><br />Please don't comment that this can't possibly work and it's all unscientific and that I'm making stuff up, as someone has on one of my other reviews.

Purchased at Folica when they had a $40 off special.<br /><br />I have thick medium length wavy fine hair.  Wash it 5-6 days a week at the gym.  Had been using their Hot Tools dryers-- two at a time, one in each hand--quite a spectacle -- and then using a flat iron.  I was happy with the end result but wanted to reduce the time spent.<br /><br />Researched the dryers to death and then just got fatigued and popped for the Sedu as it has tourmaline and ionic, and it has a regular plug-- I had some bad luck with those huge GF plugs on my hair iron.  The price is insane but since I use this nearly every day . . . .<br /><br />Compared to the Hot Tools dryer, this does not get hotter (which is a good thing because the Hot Tools is plenty hot enough to fry your hair), but it does blow more forcefully.  The dryer is small and easy to handle.  Did not find it at all heavy.  Was able to use the one dryer in one hand and brush in the other.  It still got my hair dryer faster than using the two Hot Tool dryers.  And much straighter and much smoother.  That was the surprise, and the reason I say I am a skeptic no longer.  Something about the dryer-- the tourmaline? the ions? really does make a difference.  Because my hair was already straighter by the time it was dry (since I could use the brush) the time spent using the flat iron was significantly reduced.<br />I hope that with in addition to reducing the time I have also reduced the trauma to my hair.<br /><br />I cannot tell if this is worth the big premium over the Solia and the SuperSolano which both look to be very nice dryers.

Here's what we found:<br /><br />My husband has very short hair and only uses a hairdryer on occasion.  He thought the Mangroomer felt good and solid in his hands-light weight and dries his hair no different than any other hair dryer.<br /><br />My son used the Mangroomer for a few days.  He has longer hair (about 3 inches long), just over the ears.  He traded off between a smaller, cheaper hairdryer to the Mangroomer and thought it was less noisy than the cheaper, older model he is used too.  He thought the dryer was sleek looking, more manly than the girl hairdryer he has been using.  The different speeds and temperature settings were a plus considering he's never had the choice.<br /><br />Lastly myself, I have shoulder length hair that has a course texture.  I use a hairdryer every day.  The Mangroomer looks and feels manly.  In comparison to my 1 year old Remington hairdryer, the main handle is wider and less fitted to the hand.  The buttons do not get in the way in comparison to other hairdryers that place them front and center.  The buttons on the Mangroomer are on the side, which never seem to get in the way.  The Ion button is located on the side of the barrel with a cool blue button indicator.  With or without the Ionic button I felt the dryer was the same.  A huge plus to this hairdryer is the speed in which it dries your hair.  It pushes a lot of air to dry quickly.  Another important thing to note is in comparison to my hairdryer the air does not get as hot, personally I think this is why the hair feels softer and more manageable than when I use the other hairdryer.  I actually noticed a difference in the softness of my hair.  It seems absurd to think a hairdryer can do this but as a person who dries her hair daily, I won't be going back to the other hairdryer, even if this one is built bigger for a man.",2/25/2012,5,5.0

It feels soft to the touch rather than the slick plastic of the older models. But after just a couple of weeks of use, the coating started bubbling and peeling off in the area where I hold the hair dryer. I've only had it for a month and a half, and the outer coating looks positively pathetic already. I also don't like the settings on this model--there are only two speed settings, with the lower one being barely on. The high setting is okay, but it does make me feel like I'm in a wind tunnel at times.  This hair dryer has some pros: It gets quite hot, and it's fairly lightweight.

I actually bought this at Target because my other dryer had stopped working and I couldn't wait a few days for a new one to be shipped to me. I went with the intention on getting a different one but I got to hold them both in my hand and I really liked the way this one felt. The handle is sort of slanted back, which sounds awkward but it feels more balanced this way. It also doesn't have that annoying high pitched whining sound that accompanies most dryers. I also like that there is a cold shot switch that you don't have to hold in. It stays on cold shot until you switch it off. The sliding power switch isn't difficult to slide. The tension is just right in that you're not going to accidentally switch it off constantly during use, nor will you have a hard time getting it to move.

When I first started using T3's pro ionic/ceramic hair dryer last year,I noticed and felt an immediate difference on my hair. After using it for about two months, I'm very happy with the results. My hair became more manageable and is less frizzy. It is soft and smooth. I thought all the Touramaline ionic/ceramic hair dryers would produce similar results. So I was searching for a less expensive alternative one so that I can have two ionic dryers on hand. I read the positive reviews on this Andis hair dryer, then I decided to purchase it. I'm thankful the delivery was super fast! After using it a few times, I have to say the result is just mediocre. Compare to T3, this Andis model loses its shine! My hair feels dry after using it. It doesn't seem to be able to smooth out my hair or create shine and eliminate frizz as well as the T3 does. It works just like a regular hair dryer for me, except because of the ionic in it, it does dry hair faster than non-ionic hair dryers. Overall, here are the pros & cons in my opinion on this Andis 75370 Tourmaline ionic/ceramic hair dryer.<br /><br />PROS: It has a beautiful black and gold finish on the exterior; a good size for home use; powerful air flow; dries hair fast; 3 heat settings/2 air speeds; has the cool shot button;<br /><br />CONS: feels heavy on hand & noisy; heat settings/air speeds settings are in odd position, the switches seem to get in the way while holding and using the dryer; the blue ion indicator light is extremely bright, it's very annoying; the overall result in terms of adding silkiness and shine isn't impressive; not sure if the heating material is made with solid ceramic?<br /><br />The Bottom line: This hair dryer is not bad, it does the drying job alright. I just don't think it's great for those with thick/wavy & coarse hair type hoping to get smoother and luster result after blow dry. If your hair type is normal & fine, frizz is not the major concern for you, you may be okay and satisfied with this one.w dry.

This is what sold me on this unit to begin with. My only problem with the unit is the slide buttons.  They are not raised, so it is harder to control the heat settings and also shut on and off.

I have a cheap ConAir that I keep on hand for when my good dryers break so I can get by until a good one arrives. This is a good one, and what a difference! I'm so glad it arrived quickly or my hair would've been toast! I have thick, fine, fuzzy flyaway hair and with the pik attachment I have had no problems. The only problem was on my end. When the unit arrived, I thought the spongy tape material within the concentrators were for packing purposes so removed it. I had to get some more from a local craft store so DO NOT REMOVE THAT TAPE!! My bad.<br /><br />Again, I'm not a professional but I don't want charbroiled hair either. I'm pretty confident that won't happen with either of these products and the other haircare products I use. I'm fond of haircare products with argan oil in them for its thermal protection since my stylist tells me my ends aren't bad at all; that's after she reprimands me for not coming in but every 6 to 9 months.<br /><br />I ordered the [[ASIN:B002RC8IMQ Andis Elevate Nano-diamond Ceramic Digital Flat Iron]] to go with it and was not so happy, so see that review to understand why.<br /><br />I even used the Elevate on my dog today without issue. Of course it helps that I used to groom dogs so know better than to leave it in one spot for too long which can endanger a pet by burning him/her.<br /><br />Addendum 03/15/2012<br />I've noticed a few people complain about the design of the dryer with regard to the on/off switch and utilizing the pik attachment.

The Tan Towels were just getting to be very pricey.  I found that these ones work just as well as the others!

Some may even think this is a positive, because it allows you more control over your tan.  I used these every night for 3 days and I have a wonderful natural looking glow.  Not too dark at all and not overly noticable.  These are great for us fair skinned folks that only need a bit of color.  I'm not sure you can call this a deep dark tan, but that wasn't what I was looking for anyway. These take a bit of practice to use (since you can't see where it is going on), but after becoming an expert with the Tan Towels, these were easy. Always use a circular motion! Also, I found that putting a little bit of lotion on my writs after application really helps with the steaking on my wrists (this was a problem area for me).

I haven't timed how long it takes to dry my past-shoulder length hair, but it is definitely under 5 minutes, and fast enough for me to do what I need to do.<br /><br />- leaves my hair in better condition - I always winced at using my old hairdryer because I knew I was damaging my hair in the process. I've had chronic dry hair issues and my old dryer left my hair flying every which way. I used to dry my hair only partially to lessen the damage. This dryer hasn't erased my dry hair issues completely but my hair is noticeably softer and I don't worry the way I used to about using it on my hair.<br /><br />- leaves my hair better looking - This was the biggest surprise of all. I have had such problems with my hair that I had simply resigned myself to the fact that my hair is hard-to-control. My hair is past shoulder length as mentioned, and layered. With my old dryer I absolutely needed to style my hair if I wanted to look presentable. I've spent so much money over the years trying out different brushes, rollers, etc. I could never simply wash, dry and go because with my old dryer my layers always ended up sticking out rather than curving in, and my hair would not hold any style without significant work. I was honestly shocked the first time I used the John Frieda dryer - my hair fell into a very flattering shape after 2-3 minutes of drying. I don't use a brush, don't use any of the attachments, nothing. I just dry about 90% of the way and my hair looks great. It's too bad that a month before I found this I'd already invested in a set of steam rollers. Now I won't be needing any of those tools.<br /><br />The noise level is normal for a hairdryer. I would not say it is quiet but it is not annoyingly loud. It is also quite manageable and easy to hold. I'm petite (small wrist) and I was afraid this would be a bit unwieldy, but it is lightweight enough to use without feeling at all flimpsy or cheap.<br /><br />The only fault I have found so far is the positioning of the buttons, right where my hand holds the dryer. For this reason I keep accidentally switching the air from hot to cold without wanting to. But it's a minor point given all the other advantages.eable and easy to hold.

R39GA193GGU6R0,15059026,486774008,5,3,N,False,4,Great dryer with all the features I wanted for fine hair,"I've had this dryer for over 1 1/2 years now and I love it. My hairdresser convinced me to get a new dryer so I picked her brain for what features to look for. When my daughter said she wanted a new dryer I pulled out the list of features my hairdresser gave me and that made me think to share it here.   1) concentrator  That's the main thing my old one lacked and why it was worth buying a new one - just for that. I have shorter hair and use a curved brush to style in shape; the concentrator focuses the heat on the curve I'm styling and it does make a big difference. The dryer also comes with a diffuser but that's for completely different hair than I have.  2) power - my stylist gave me a number of Watts and I don't remember the number but this unit exceeds it. This is something to be careful of anyway. We had an electrician looking at a problem with blowing the bathroom circuit and he said it's common for new hairdryers to blow the circuits on old houses because new ones are so much more powerful. That turned out NOT to be our circuit problem but thought I'd mention that there are practical limits to high power that are a pain to cross. This dryer puts out all the heat my scalp can take.  3) cleanable vent- the back grille should be easy to open & clean out lint. Major impact on strength of the fan & on life span of the appliance if you keep the lint out.  4) 3 heat settings  5) 3 fan settings (this unit is actually a compromise with only two fan speeds + off but I always use high anyway 'cause  I'm impatient)  6) swivel cord vs. retractable cord - My hairdresser said she looks for a swivel cord but it was pretty well impossible to find in less expensive models even in beauty supply stores (realize pros pay over $100 for professional hairdryers) I looked high and low for this feature. It probably extended my search for a new hairdryer by almost a full year. I finally gave up on it when I set my sights on a retractable cord. The retractable feature also seems to keepthe cord tangle free. My curling iron has a swivel cord but it gets more tangled because it gets all scrunched up in the drawer. My biggest concern was that the retractable cord would give out but it's still going strong after 1 1/2 years. I love this feature as it keeps my dryer neatly tucked away in its drawer.   7) cold shot - My hairdresser didn't include this feature because she doesn't use it  but I wouldn't buy a dryer without it. This is a button that, when pushed in, makes the dryer switch to unheated air which sets a curl/curve much, much better. it takes a little more time to style the hair (which is why hairdressers often don't use it) but my style lasts days longer. Easy feature to find but it's not universal so if you want it you need to check for it and this dryer does have it. It's the blue button on the top of the handle.  Bottom line: I love this dryer. If it's been a while since you bought a new one, go for it. You'll be amazed at what a time saver it is. At this price from Amazon, it's a great value. In my area Target & Walmart sell this dryer for $5 more plus tax.  I'd buy it again in a heart beat.",1/1/2012,5,5.0

If it's quiet, it's a big bonus.<br /><br />My favorite is this: http://www.amazon.com/Sharper-Image-Ionic-Conditioning-SI745/dp/B00007M1U2/ref=cm_cr_pr_pb_t , the Sharper Image ionic hair dryer. I like the travel version because it's light weight, yet delivers just as much power and air. Too bad this is no longer in production.<br /><br />I also enjoyed this: http://www.amazon.com/Healthy-Infusions-Wahl-Pro-Dryer/dp/B001E6G6FC/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top , and I use it as my alternative hair dryer when I can't access my Sharper Image dryer. This one, too, delivers great air flow at an appropriate temperature and dries my hair quickly and gently.<br /><br />Now, to our product at hand... it's heavy compares to the two I had just mentioned. It's not any more quiet. I don't generally use the air diffuser on my Wahl, but I do use it on my Sharper Image. I tried using the diffuser with this Remington, but whether I use it or not, my hair gets very tangled afterward, which isn't a problem with neither of the two I had mentioned. It also does not dry quickly as the title implies, nor does it make my hair feel anymore healthy than before I use it. In fact, rather than taking half the time to dry my hair, I think it doubles the time.<br /><br />My hair is past the middle of my back, so it's a bit long. Maybe this is a great dryer for shorter hair? I don't know. I can't recommend this to others.

This is it. My hair is thin and wimpy, but still takes several minutes to dry. The longer it takes to dry, the frizzier it gets. (I'm not a pro when it comes to drying my hair. Far from it.) Even if the humidity is high, with this dryer my hair dries fast, frizz-free and straight.     It is heavy for my arthritic hands and arms, so I use a hair dryer stand, similar to [...], that I purchased many years ago at a drug store in their Made for TV section. I haven't timed it, but it seems to take less than five minutes to completely dry my hair.     The cord is approximately six feet long, long enough for my use since I don't walk around while drying my hair. The temperature and air control on the handle are slide levers. With arthritis, particularly bad in my thumbs, I find it somewhat difficult to adjust them, thus the four-star rating.     Color-wise, I'd describe it as a rich salmon. I don't see a purpose to the clear encasement over the dual fans, but that doesn't bother me one way or the other.

I've burned through cheaper, store-bought hair dryers in the past. I bought an Andis many years ago and it was wonderful, so I bought this model in June 2009, and sadly today in December 2011 it finally fizzled out.<br /><br />The dryer works extremely quickly. I remember comparing it to the past model I had, and the reason I've stuck with Andis since because of their efficiency (and longevity). I have naturally loose-curly hair, and I use this dryer daily to straighten my hair with a round brush. It allows my hair to retain a lot of body, come out super-soft, and avoid frizz!<br /><br />While the switches on the handle are kind of in a bad place, I eventually got used to it and rarely do I accidentally turn it off. It's not hard to turn back on, so I don't see it as that big of an issue.<br /><br />I've had great customer service experience with Andis in the past as well. The plastic piece that holds the filter on the back of the dryer (at the air intake) broke and no longer functioned. I also broke one of the attachments.

I would not suggest this item for women of darker skin. I myself am Caucasian but I have medium thickness, curly hair and I can just barely use it.

I also love that the dryer has a loop so that I could hang it on a hook (as my bathroom doesn't have much storage space).

The Remington didn't last me long (less than a year) and in general was a mediocre hair dryer but it got the job done.<br /><br />I'll start with the cons: I have thick long straight hair with a natural wave, my day to day hair style is scrunched. I have a universal diffuser that I love to use, it's huge and has high sides that are easy to scoop my long hair into. Unfortunately the first thing I noticed about the John Frieda Hair Dryer is the unusual shape of the nozzle. It is big and short and my universal diffuser does not fit it, nor will any universal diffuser on the market (at least I haven't found one yet). So I'm forced to use the attached diffuser that came with it. It does the job but it's not as easy to use as my old one. The buttons are also in a very awkward place, right where my thumb sits when I'm holding it so I'm constantly turning the temperature down by accident. I also end up hitting the cool shot button all the time. It takes some adjustment to get used to.<br /><br />Otherwise, this hair dryer is excellent, it's extremely powerful. It has cut my hair drying time down by half. Most of the time I don't even use it on full heat. If you don't use a diffuser or aren't married to using a larger universal one, I would definitely recommend this hair dryer. If it wasn't so awesome, I would probably return it for not fitting my diffuser but I think using the included one will be an okay compromise for me.",12/3/2011,4,4.0

I remarked to my husband at how quickly I was able to dry my hair (even with the Florida humidity) and that I wanted one of the dryers.  Since I could get it on Amazon for $13.99, I thought what the heck, I won't be gambling too much if it doesn't work.

This one lasted a month. The previous one -- a forty dollar item -- lasted two months and almost caused a fire while I was using it. I do not recommend Revlon hair dryers and will not purchase one again.  -----  Added on Oct 13, 2011:  Well, once it started showing overheating problems that I recognized from previous Revlon dryer, I went ahead and ordered an Andis 1600 watt which is also a very low price but pretty strong hair dryer. My previous Andis worked for several years with no problem and I loved it before it conked out on me and I would have ordered another but it was out of stock at the time, so I ordered the Revlon instead. Sigh. So, one month later I am tossing the Revlon and fortunately the Andis is back in stock now and arrived two days before my Revlon popped loudly and frizzled and fried and died an ignominious death this evening. So I had a back up in place. Thank you Andis! I will not be buying anything but Andis hair dryers from now on. The Revlon is not worth buying IMO.",10/10/2011,1,1.0

RHLJM0K087A6,20186080,194533684,1,3,N,False,6,Are you kidding me with these reviews?,"I just paid 189.00 for this hair dryer on another site (not Amazon) because I read the reviews Amazon is NOT an authorized dealer and the problems people had with this dryer and returning it (or warranty, whatever).  My least concern was this I just wanted to be sure I was getting the Evolution and not some other model with the name Evolution  on it.  First, OMG..what /who are these people on here giving this hair dryer such rave reviews?  This dryer is NOT EVEN 1600 WATTS!!!!!!!!!!@!!!!!!!!!!!!!  How can anyone say best hair dryer ever. no need for the low setting as the high is perfect, blah blah.  I am convinced that I can no longer go by reviews on here. This dryer is in NO WAY 2000 watts.  I can hold the nozzle (with the nozzle on which is more extreme air flow) right to my skin and my sking doesnt even get close to warm.  How can this dryer be 20000 watts when it is barely blowing out any air to even directly make it to my round brush and it doesnt burn my skin at all directly up against my skin on the highest setting, which is supposed to be Hot?  This is in now way hot, no way 20000 watts, I dont even think this is 1600.  What are all you people thinking to write reveiws with a dryer that is no stronger than a conair at CVS?  I cannot in good conscious keep a dryer that I paid almost 200 for where my vidal sassoon dryer gives off more air flow.  I have NO RESPECT for a company that LIES to every one, puts out a dryer that is even in the news and yet sells top popele the EXACT OPPOSITE>?  Why are not you all saying the truth.  I have the dryer.  It is not even 1600 watts and that is no lie.  Plus, I paid 200 for a dryer where the cold button i have to hold down???  The cheaper dryers, yes.  But I also bought an 1875 BioIonic dryer and it blows stronger and harder than this piece of garbage.  AND its cool button stays cool without holding it down.  The only positive of this dryer is light weight.  But I can get that at the local drug store for 30.00  Pleaswe people, THINK before you write reviews and be honest.  I have to believe these sites are deceptive becau8se I have the dryer, I used it and it is clearly and no mistake or even maybe..THIS IS CLEARLY NOT EVEN 1600 WATTS, so light air flow I thought my electric ay be the problem.  So light it didnt burn my skin on highest hot setting up agaqinst my arm.  Are you kidding me people?  This is NOT A DRYER WORTH $50.00.  DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE and I for one will never EVER trust this company again. They have wasted my money, time and now I have to return this piece of garbage.

R2J9HJB4DQUBS6,48755970,258419037,5,2,Y,False,3,Well done John Frieda!,"I got this dryer for my wife as she has fine, relatively delicate hair and every dryer she has ever used has made it dry and harder to manage (in the past I heard many complaints). Did this dryer fare any better? Well she hasn't had that problem with this dyer, and to me that's saying A LOT.<br /><br />John Frieda is a salon product label not an appliance manufacturer, but they seem to have chosen quite well the bathroom appliance to put their name on. It's well designed, attractive, and (most importantly) well-built and effective as what it's designed to be used for. As my wife is the hair-care expert I relied on her expert experience with this device for the bulk of the info for this review. But for the record, here's my two cents: Her hair looks less damaged, smoother and softer, has less split ends, and in general looks healthier with use of this device. The only downside I can see is that it IS a bit large. Now on to her opinions...<br />The number one thing my wife said she likes about the dryer is the ample number of heat and speed settings. These allow you to customize the dryer to your specific hair texture in order to dry your hair as quickly as possible, with the least damage done. It also has a cold shot button, a feature she would like better if it had a lock. It gets tiring trying to hold the button continually.<br /><br />She also likes that it comes with three attachments (a diffuser and two concentrators). These are made of sturdy plastic, and are very easy to snap on and off the nozzle. However, they do heat up very quickly during use so switching between them while blow drying can be a little uncomfortable. The device also has a nice long power cord which is convenient.<br />The only really `con' with this dryer would be its size. We have very limited storage space in my bathroom and this dryer takes up a lot of space. However, considering everything else this dryer has to offer it's not a deal breaker in the least. I would recommend this dryer to anyone looking for a fast and effective dryer, that won't cause a lot of damage to your hair, (even with daily use). Especially recommended to people with fine or delicate hair. It's an excellent value for a great price.

She uses a hair drier frequently and have seen her with frizzy hair from it at times. I figured this would be a perfect test.<br /><br />The dryer has a balanced feel to it and isn't too heavy. The body is made of plastic that feels solid. If you squeeze it will creak and crack but it still feels solid. The intake and output screens are metal and should hold up well. It has a very nice cable stress relief on the dryer side that looks like it will help with and last through all the waving around that is sure to come. The plug side has a nice and compact GFI built into it so you are less likely to die from using it. Size wise I think this is a stay at home dryer. I would look for something a bit more compact for travel if you need one.<br /><br />The side of the handle contains two switches. One for temperature (cool, warm, and hot) one for speed (off, low, and high). There is a momentary switch on the handle in the trigger position for the cool shot function.<br /><br />After turning her loose with this for a few weeks my wife says her hair definitely is less frizzy and feels softer after using this dryer versus her other dryer.

It is both powerful and hot and helps to take a few minutes out your morning routine. While it has many of the same features and attachments of other hair dryers it does offer salon style performance.<br /><br />Notes-<br /><br /> - Heats up very quickly<br /> - Long cord - probably 8-10 feet which allows you a little freedom from your outlet<br /> - 3 speeds and three heat settings<br /> - The back screen lifts up so that you can clean the dryer motor<br /> - It is a bit heavy, which is the reason for removing one star<br /> - Nice look to the dryer - it certainly does not look or feel cheap<br /> - Three attachments including a diffuser and two concentrators<br /> - 1875 watts (watch to make sure you do not trip your circuit breaker)<br /><br />Final Verdict - This is a well-built machine that will likely last you for many years.

Looks good and performs better.<br />The 1800+ watts drys your hair faster than the typical 1500 watt units most companies sell yet the motor is quieter than these other units.<br />The only point that some may consider a negative is that it isn't very portable. No retracting power cords, no folding handles. But it isn't meant to be portable. Most people use their dryers at home anyway and travelers will have to either accept its somewhat larger size because of its superior performance and lack of carrying case or look for a portable unit.<br /><br />This dryer has three speeds where most dryers only have two. It has three attachments, one is a diffuser (T3 charges an extra $20-30 JUST for their diffuser alone) to puff up your hair with its teeth that have air outlets at the end of each tooth and two different styles of concentrators to develop very high air speeds and concentrate the drying for quicker performance (works great for drying a spill spot on your clothing).<br /><br />It also has a cool button to blow cold air which is handy for spraying hair spray and then fixing your hair in that position. I find it also handy for blowing dust out of the fans and keyboard of my computer as well.<br /><br />Finally, it is not too heavy despite its thicker plastic construction. Some have criticized it as not having a metal body. It disagree, A metal body would be heavier and is also dangerous where electric and water are present, which is where many people use their hair dryers.<br /><br />So not only is a metal body more tiring to use for any amount of time but is hazardous to your heath if used in a bathroom. Pro dryers may be metal bodied but a beauty salon is not a bathroom and it is handled by a beautician, not yourself, so the dangers are minimized a great deal.<br /><br />If you want a pro performing dryer without paying the pro prices ($120-200) they cost, this is the dryer for you.",8/18/2011,4,4.0

There are not many wall mount hair dryers to pick from, and I mostly liked this one while it worked.  BRIGHT night light (can be good or bad.. I liked it), nice physical design, and decent power.  I thought the air volume still did not compete with most $15 standard dryers, but if you are not looking for big air volume, it is fine. My wife misses a cold button.  So in all, a mediocre hair dryer but with great wall mount convenience and bright night light.  Now with the issues... Bought 18 months ago, worked fine except overheated very easily. If used on HIGH, it would run as long as you want till you shut it off, then the internal temperature would apparently overheat with no more airflow, and would refuse to turn back on for 5 minutes or so.  Annoying, but I got used to it by going to medium heat for about 10 seconds before shutting it off every time.  That seemed to cool it down just enough not to trigger the temperature limiter in case I needed to turn it back on right away.  I probably would have pitched it, but I liked the wall mount convenience and put 4 holes in my wall to mount it.  Well, here we are 18 months of life, and now it is completely dead. Night light on but the hair dryer is not home. I am electrically capable and could probably open up and fix this thing, but it is not worth the safety concern.  If you want to pay a premium for wall mount, just know you might only get a year or two out of it.. others seems to have similar experiences.  Sad that the $10 hand held models seem to last much longer.  Anyway, to cover up the holes in the walls, I am trying one of the other few wall mount options out there by another manufacturer.

Except since the bonnet gets too hot to touch, I attach a clothespin to it and hold the clothespin up for the 50 minutes that the henna is cooking.

Although it is not over-powering it takes a bit of getting used to, it smells like the old lanse-sa treatments at the hair salon. Another complaint is I do suffer from acne and this product seems to aggravate acne problems if used during a break-out. A word of warning, this stuff is very difficult to get out of hair so be careful where you apply it.

I've tried a number of other Conair dryers, and none of them got quite hot enough, so I figured I'd give this one a try.    My hair: mid-back, quite thick, wavy/curly and frizz prone.  I usually dry it straight with a round brush instead of flat ironing, so I need a dryer that gets very hot.    Things I like about the dryer:    1. Great heat settings.  My old dryer went from hot to scalding.  This one blows truly cold air for the cool shot, cool air on low, warm on warm, and scalding on hot.  I was surprised by how well it dried my hair on warm (I usually use the highest setting the whole time), but I did need to use the hottest setting to get my hair straight.  This dryer gets hotter than anything I've tried in this price range, which for me is a huge plus.    2. Relatively quiet.  It sounds like a hair dryer, but is considerably quieter than any other product I've tried.      3. Good weight/feel.  Other reviewers have said it's heavy, but at least compared to the other Conair dryers I've used, I'd say it's about the same, maybe lighter.  Definitely not a problem unless you're used to a really, really lightweight dryer.  The surface is nice and grippy, and the balance feels good.    Overall, I'm very satisfied.

RFO3CI9YX7T1D,12399670,442401590,3,6,N,True,7,Not as good as the previous Tourmaline,"I have thin, fine hair and need to heat & rapidly cool the roots while back-brushing to get lift and fullness.  I had the previous model of this blow dryer and it worked very well for this purpose.  Unfortunately, after about a year the blower switch broke right in half.  I bought this one to replace it.  I like that the dryer is reasonably priced so I didn't feel too ripped off at having to buy a new one.  This one has a couple of manufacturing changes, though, that I felt were downgrades. First and foremost, this one has a 6' cord, where the previous model had a 9' cord.  The cord doesn't swivel, so the extra length gave me more flexibility in movement, whereas this one makes the dryer seem cheap.  Second, Remington changed the direction of the blower switch, rather arbitrarily, so that up is now off instead of high.  I know this sounds petty, but that change removed the automaticity of my hand movements completely and I couldn't see a good reason to change it.  It probably won't be a problem for you if you didn't have the earlier model.    The drawback to the original, which is still a drawback on the current model, is that it has so much power even in the low setting that when I'm back-brushing I don't have good control over the hair.  On the earlier model I felt this was still workable and if you want lots of blow-power this model definitely fits the bill.    I ended up coming across a BaByliss Pro Porcelain Ceramic that I could try before buying, and even though it cost more I bought it anyway and am keeping this one as my spare.  It has the longer cord, heat and blower controls and while it has plenty of power it doesn't blow quite as hard on the low blower setting.  Since I was having to re-learn the controls on the T-Studio anyway, I figured I might as well get a longer cord out of the deal.",6/8/2011,3,3.0

RRYCPVX8E0TTC,21102295,47684938,5,1,N,False,1,Great Hair Dryer With Some Surprising Benefits,"I was able to get this directly from Amazon for $20.  I give it 5 stars because I think it is a great hair dryer overall for my purposes, and excellent also for the price.      I don't use this for travel but really like the retractable cord.  Actually I don't bother retracting it, but like the fact that I can keep just a relatively short but usable length of cord out all the time, which doesn't clutter up the counter.  With every other hair dryer I have ever had the cord was way too long and got in the way.  This hair dryer wouldn't be my first choice for travel, by the way, because it is a bit big and heavy as compared to other travel hair dryers.    At the maximum speed the airflow is probably less than most other dryers, but is sufficient for me.  Another potential negative for some people might be the larger than normal handle circumference, but you get used to it, and for me this size is actually perfect.    Another surprise regarding this hair dryer is that my hair is more shiny now, it must be the ceramic or ionic thing.  Being ceramic it is supposed to have more even heat, which is less likely to damage your hair.  Whatever is causing this effect, I like it, and was noticeable right away.    Lastly I am guessing this will last a while, given the 5 year warranty.  I previously was using another $20 hair dryer purchased at a local store, and they lasted an average of 6 months before breaking.  This one seems like it will last, and I won't have any issues with the cord retraction mechanism possibly wearing out since I never change the cord length.",6/5/2011,5,5.0

This dryer has cut the time it takes to dry my hair from 45 mins. to 25-30 mins. (depending on how damp my hair is when I start)  The only reason I did not give it a 5 star rating is because after the first two weeks of using the concentrator tool on a daily basis it no longer fits snug on the dryer.  It doesn't come off during use but it does rotate around and I am constantly repositioning it which is a bit annoying.  I've only had it for a few months so I can't comment on it's lifespan.

I am a sucker for anything different, and this fit the bill. I washed my hair right after I bought it so I could check it out. After using it all I could think of were these three words: No Me Gusta. I didn't even finish drying my hair with it, my Conair takes me 5 minutes tops to dry my thick, shoulder length hair. I was on 20 minutes with this one and I had had enough. Also, it kept sucking my hair into the vents which was rather painful. This hair dryer is severely lacking oomph. It takes me less time to dry my hair with my old conair and style separately then it would have taken me to style and dry with this thing.     I am returning it tomorrow and I'll buy a regular blow dryer.     Once again, NO ME GUSTA.",4/30/2011,5,3.0

Your hand won't fall off after using it! :)<br /><br />Usable Attachment.  I wasn't aware when I bought this, but it has an attachment on the end to focus the heat for styling. Since I have hair that curves in and frames the face, this is PERFECT for getting that look!  I only have to go over it once in order for it to be perfect.<br /><br />Hot and Cold.  The cold is actually NOT hot. Yes, it's not hot! Amazing! LOL  And the hot doesn't burn your eyelashes off!

After researching many available on Amazon and other websites, I chose the Andis model because it offered the nighlight and a place for the cord. I've been using it now for two months.     Since it was going to take up a permanent spot in my outlet, it having a nightlight was dead useful.  I read other reviews saying that the nightlight was way too bright.  My husband and I disagree. We love the amount of light put out by the hairdryer.  It is signficantly brighter than our old nightlight which means you can get up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom and never have to turn on the overhead light.  Isn't that the point of a nightlight?  Maybe the people who dislike the amount of light have it in a master bath and don't close the door to the bathroom and it bothers them when they sleep? My solution would be to shut the bathroom door in that case!    Sorry that this turned into a review of the nightlight feature!  The hairdryer gives you as 1400 or 1600 watt option and I use it on the 1600 because I have massively thick hair.  It dries my hair quickly and is not obnoxiously loud.  I like that it has a cord keeper and keeps everything tidy in my teeny bathroom.

I invested a couple hours researching on line and reviewing the products here at Amazon. In the end, I selected the Conair Ion Shine because it was 1875 watts, was an ionizer, was priced affordably, and the design seemed good.<br /><br />Now that I have received the item and have had some time to use it, here are my ratings:<br />STORABILITY: 2.5 stars  There is a hanging loop, but  the cord is heavy and awkward. The unit is heavy enough that whatever hook one would hang it from would have to be substantially mounted so it would not pull out of the wall. (Wall mounting is not an option for me). Also, after only two uses, the cord has already begun to twist, which is a negative.<br />VALUE: 4.5 stars  I knew the Amazon price was reasonable, even lower than my local discount stores. After I purchased this item,  I found the same model at BIG LOTS for a dollar more and in different colors.<br />PERFORMANCE:  5 stars  Dries hair quickly without using high heat temps. Unit comes with a few attachments. The diffuser is really large and awkward to store. The unit has a hinged filter that opens easily for cleaning. The removable filter is the standard small piece of material that I have seen in other high-tech fan devices, including the high-end SmartTechnologies Smart Board in my classroom. I'm figuring the filter material is pretty standard. In my previous hair dryer, the fan did not have a removable filter for cleaning; eventually the old fan clogged so horribly (despite my attempts to brush it out)that it slowed down and eventually killed the unit.<br /><br />Other note: If a younger child will be using the unit, she may find the unit feels heavy or hard to hold after a while.

They don't take up space on your bathroom counter, you don't have to wrap the cord around and around your hair dryer (which can eventually lead to internal wire damage), and you don't have to find a separate place to store it.  I never thought of actually owning one in my own home until I visited my sister a few years ago, and she had this one mounted on her guest bathroom wall.  It worked great, and I knew right then that I needed one of these.  I wrote down the model number and went online to buy one as soon as I returned home.  My husband was more than happy to install this (a couple of screws) since it meant no more hair dryers laying on the bathroom sink.  We both liked it so much that he even suggested that I go ahead and buy another one and have it on hand for when the first one wore out.

The thing I liked most about the older dryer, and which I like about this one (which is basically the same dryer with a new color and model number), is that it doesn't get excessively hot even on the highest setting, and doesn't blow as hard as most other dryers.      For someone with thick hair this might be a real problem, but I've got very thin, fine, slightly frizzy hair that doesn't benefit from a strong airflow.  Most hair dryers, even on lower speeds, dry sections of my hair so rapidly that I don't have a proper chance to style them with a brush, and the rest of my rather sparse hair gets whipped around as if in a tornado.  That doesn't happen with this Vidal Sassoon model.  The oval-shaped barrel seems to also help concentrate the airflow.      I also like the fact that this dryer has three heat settings and two speed settings which can be selected independently.  With some dryers high speed is paired with high heat whether you want it or not.      The ionic setting on this dryer DOES make a difference and makes my hair a tad smoother - however it also tends to make it more limp.  So as a rule, I use the dryer with the ion setting in the off position except when drying the ends of my shoulder-length hair.  Probably someone with thick, coarse hair wouldn't have this issue.         I've had this dryer for only about 5 weeks, so it's too early to comment on whether it's built to last - I was definitely lucky to get so many years out of my older model.  This model might not be just right for every head of hair, but for mine, it's perfect.  I hope Vidal Sassoon continues making this type of dryer for a long time.",3/2/2011,5,5.0
R17LERZ6LT0Y7Z,43043013,670161917,4,255,N,False,275,About the 220 V Settings,"NOTE:  I do not own this hair dryer, but to add a review I had to add a star rating.  I used the average of 4 stars to keep the rating unchanged.<br /><br />PLEASE NOTE that a lot of these hair dryers do nothing more than mechanically lock out the on-off switch from using the HI TEMP setting WHEN set for 220 volt input for foreign countries.  That is very typical.<br /><br />PLEASE ALSO NOTE that the Low Heat mode at 220 volts does not work the same as 110 volts.  From an electrical point of reference, doubling the voltage yields a four fold increase in power (wattage).  If the Low Heat mode at 110 volts (USA value) is 400 watts, then using this dryer in Low Heat mode at 220 volts (eg, Europe) would generate 1600 watts.  That's the way the power equation works.  That's how my current unit worked when we vacationed in Europe.  Low Heat mode at 220 volts generates high heat and a fast fan speed.<br /><br />WHAT you lose is the low power curling and shaping mode when using these dryers at 220 volts.  There is no 400 watt option in the 220 volt setting.<br /><br />If you want both HIGH and LOW Heat modes, buy a transformer to convert 220 to 110 volts (and be sure it is big enough, power wise, to handle the 110 volt High Heat wattage).  The cost, beyond the purchase price of the transformer, is the added transformer weight in your travel luggage.<br /><br />I hope this clarifies how these type hair dryers work in Europe....  a retired Electrical Engineer.<br /><br />PS:  Going from USA 60 Hertz (a.k.a. 60 cycles) to European 50 Hertz makes no difference for this appliance.<br /><br />PPS: None of the 220 V countries use our 110 V two prong or three prong wall plug.  Even if you don't buy the transformer,<br />  you will need a plug converter kit to plug this hair dryer into the 220 V wall outlet (found with the luggage in most department stores or on<br />  Amazon under Plug Converter - but be sure to get the 220 to 110 version and not the 110 to 220 for Europeans visiting USA).",3/2/2011,4,4.0

Final dry down is to a rich and exceptionally warm woody oak-moss with a powdery overlay. Soapy-clean permeates throughout the entire range of the scent.  This is mature, masculine and a barbershop-clean classic. Makes Creed's version seem flat and incredibly overpriced.<br /><br />The EDT miniature is splash only (no spray).

I bought the Conair 223X Cord Reel Dryer in August 2010 at a large chain drugstore for about $35.  It worked fine and I had no complaints. I liked the sassy color and the retractable cord feature.  I have super thick hair that can frizz in humid weather.  I didn't see any improvement in frizz when using the dryer. I guess it dried my hair quickly, but I don't remember noticing that it dried it any faster than my pervious hair dryer.    Today I went to dry my hair and the dryer wouldn't work.  I pushed the reset button on the plug and it wouldn't reset. I pushed the reset button on my outlet and it was working.  I tested my outlet with other things and the outlet was working.  The tag on the plug said I should refer to the user manual.   I found it on Conair's website but it was not helpful (they actually had the wrong user manual uploaded to the hairdryer). So I called the number on the site, and a polite gentleman answered in less than one ring. I explained the problem, he asked me a few questions, and then looked up the warranty.  The item is under warranty for 3 years, so I am eligible for a new dryer. HOWEVER, I have to ship it to Conair's headquarters in Arizona, I have to enclose a note explaining the problem, along with the service # he generated for me, and then I have to enclose a check or money order for 3 dollars to cover shipping and handling of a new dryer to my home.     I'm really disappointed that after only 6 short months of very occasional use (i was only drying my hair maybe 4 times a MONTH) the dryer has stopped working.  I'm also disappointed that I have to go through a rigamarole to have the dryer replaced.  With today's technology, they could easily email me a voucher for a new dryer.

Especially if you have a thicker hair structure (wavy, curly), or your hair falls naturally in a certain way but you want it to be styled in an opposite direction. Using more hair product helps a little, but a stronger air current will work better (even though it is more damaging for your hair & scalp, so USE CAREFULLY AND WISELY)<br /><br />I figured there are enough men out there looking for just this function, so I figured I'd help you all out.",2/9/2011,5,4.0

It actually kicks when you start it, that's how much air rushes out of the nozzle. The warm air drying field - because of the dryer's unusual strength - is wider and more focused than any other that I've tried. The controls are remarkably easy to use. They require hardly any pressure, seeming to respond instantly when pressed. Ergonomically the Remington Ac2015 is well designed, fitting in my hand quite comfortably. Other hair dryers are often indifferently designed, their weight soon tiring your hands and arms requiring constant switching between left and right hands. This dryer stayed in my right hand without cramping or fatigue, which I really appreciate.<br /><br />The three heat settings and two speeds are perfect for the subtle changes your hair undergoes during the drying process. There's a big difference between the extremely wet hair you confront when first leaving the shower and the dryer, more responsive hair you have after a couple of minutes of drying. With the different heat settings and two speeds - coupled with the dryer's strength - I manage to avoid some of the heat damage that I used to inflict on my hair. Back then, I was forced to crank-up my inferior dryer in order to get better (and quicker) drying. Heat damaged, overly dry (even dessicated) hair is unmanageable and very unsightly. I am thankful those days appear to be gone for good. The attachments are easy to add and use though I never need them, finding the dryer in its native state to be best for my hair. The dryer runs quietly and without sparking, something that can be worrisome when your hands are moist.

R1EAXO2MAQND28,52204230,238410319,2,4,N,True,5,HEAVY! HOT! Useless pick attachment. Awful button placement.,"**Review about BLACK CHROME version.**<br /><br />It's always a pain buying a new hair dryer--you're used to the one you had, annoyances and all, and it's a crap shoot as to whether or not you'll like the one you've bought sight unseen (although you've read the reviews and are hopeful).<br /><br />I wanted to love this hair dryer, but overall I just didn't.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed is that it is HEAVY. Well, not a bag of flour heavy, but it certainly has a definite heft to it (heavier than I was used to, at least) and for someone who needs to spend a good 30 constant minutes holding it and moving it around...it was heavier than I'd prefer.<br /><br />The second thing I noticed is that the cord is REALLY long. I never gave much thought to cord length, but it is advertised as 10 feet and I'm sure it is. I can't say as if I ever need a cord that long--in all my years using a hair dryer, I think a 3' cord would be plenty.<br /><br />The third thing I noticed was that the attachments are metal--which at first I thought was a bonus because it meant they would be sturdier. That said, since they are metal, they get HOT during use! Surprise, I know, right? Hee. But when you're used to plastic and suddenly have metal and you forget and grab the end...OUCH! Also, the attachments were a bit of a pain to put on. I had to fight with one of them because it didn't seem to want to click on easily (or at least as easily as any dryer I'd used before). I did finally get it on, and thought Well, at least it will STAY on. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case with the resin pick attachment, which, in addition to being super awkward to use, came flying off the end in about seven seconds. The other concentrator attachments were fine, but that pick one was useless.<br /><br />The fourth thing I noticed is that the button placement SUCKS. I managed to turn it off at least 10 times in the first two minutes of using it. SOOOOO frustrating. Just grabbing the handle to hold it would bump it to OFF. GRRRRR. I tried to be especially mindful of it for the rest of the usage period, and I did get better, but I still turned it off repeatedly.<br /><br />The fifth and final thing I noticed is that the hot is REALLY SUPER HOT. I mean, so hot that you do have to really be careful how long you point it at your scalp--and I'd NEVER use it on my hair without putting some form of styling protectant on it first.<br /><br />Taking everything into consideration, this was NOT the hair dryer for me. AT ALL. It was too heavy (minus one star), had hard-to-attach and useless attachments (minus one star), and had sucky button placement (minus one star). It's going back.ially mindful of it for the rest of the usage period, and I did get better, but I still turned it off repeatedly.

At first, it leaves somewhat of a greyish cast but i think this neutralizes yellowish asian undertones once product settles into skin.  Later skin79 gold adjusts a bit to my skin color though i think it is a tad light for me.  i think longevity is about 3-4 hours with primer so i put a finishing powder (drugstore brand) over it so it would last 6-8hrs?  Using a powder similar to your coloring will help make this skin79 product 'match up' to ur skin coloring (IF you are about nc30 or more).  I really think powdering is a must for this product.  Honestly, i have to have powder for this or it wont last long and coloring looks  a bit off.  It isnt drying, and u dont become 'oily' after several hours (not quite dewy but healthy moisturized skin).  You never feel u r wearing makeup with this on (even with primer + BB cream +powder).<br /><br />Compared to other products:  i feel it does 'brighten' the face a bit compared to the other skin79 sampler items.  I found oriental bb gold too oily at the end of day (though loved its initial dewiness),  pink one made my skin look dead and didnt last long and blemish diamond bb cream was too sparkly to use.  I have also used Sephora and laura merceir oil-less tinted moisturizer and found these too oily and 'dead-looking' respectively on my skin.  Laura mercier brand oxidized way too much for me and made me feel like i was wearing a fake mask at end of the day (i even tried 2-3 different shades!).  Christian dior TM broke me out as well as the other skin79 items esp. oriental bb gold.<br /><br />this is a good product to be honest...despite of the minor negatives above esp. not matching to skin color and lack of longetivity without use of powder.

I have some hyperpigmentation from sun damage and monthly blemishes.  I have maybe had 2 facials in my life so my skin was not used to such a high concentration of salicylic acid, or any other kind of acid for that matter.  I have used the product about 4 times now.  The first time I used it I literally felt like the skin was burning off my face.  After the fourth use it's at the point where it still burns but it's not unbearable and I can last the whole 10 minutes.      Although the peel is painful it has definitely been worth it.  I was afraid I would have a lot of dry skin on my face which would show through my makeup since I have semi-dry skin already but it honestly wasn't that bad.  There were probably 3 small dry patches but you couldn't see them through my makeup and after the second day I used a dry washcloth and wiped the dry skin off.  My skin is very smooth now and the hyperpigmentation is almost gone.  Before I would never go out in public without makeup on because I felt like people could see my age in the condition of my skin but now I have no problem going out with a clean face.  I have used a number of products of all price ranges in the past to minimize the hyperpigmentation and nothing ever worked.  This is the first product I have ever used with success.      If you can't stand the pain and can only tolerate a minute or two the first couple times you use this product you will still see outstanding results.  Also, it says to use lotion after using the peel but I have been putting on toner and that has really been a more effective way of moisturizing my skin immediately after using the peel.

I figured she'd be the perfect person to rate this against a number of other dryers. Here's what she said:<br /><br />First of all, this hair dryer looks sleek (chocolate brown with powder pink accents) and it doesn't look bad or distracting just sitting by the sink or on the dresser. (Some huge salon models that look like they power wind tunnels are much more obtrusive.) This one is rather long and slightly heavier, however, than the Con Air Infinity hair dryer I've been using, so it took a little getting used to the heft. The noise level is average (the same as Con Air), but it dries my hair much faster and seems like it gives more volume to my hair. The speed also allows me to style my hair better and it stays that way longer. While most blow dryers have multiple settings, this Remington really has noticeable differences between the settings, with warm being warm and hot actually being hot instead of a little warmer. The selection switches on this model are also much easier to change to get to those settings, and unlike most slide switch type models, they can be changed on the fly while styling without having to fumble and fret with the dryer.

I was very happy with the dryer, as it was powerful and offered a reasonable selection of temperatures.  I exercised proper care for the dryer and never abused it.  However, Friday morning I turned the dryer on, and since it is getting cold, I decided to use high heat instead of medium heat like I almost always choose.

I unplugged the dryer and have not plugged it back in since.<br /><br />I went to Target to find a replacement, and was disappointed.  None of them performed as well as this one.  But I'm afraid to buy another.  What has the world come to when you can't even buy a decent hair dryer for less than $75 unless you're willing to accept this kind of crappy workmanship?  I guess the solution is to buy them in quantity and treat them as disposable.<br /><br />If it didn't perform so well (when it wasn't producing smoke and fire) then I'd give it the minimum score... but since it really does work nice, I'll give it two stars.

This blow dryer is one of the best available at major retailers today. When I went shopping for a new blow dryer, this one actually looked sturdier than its bulkier, more expensive Conair cousins, with their breakable diffusers and fragile-looking reset buttons. The d5000's compact size makes it easy to hold, and it won't take up much space on on your bathroom counter when you're done with it. Although it's touted as a travel dryer, I find that it makes a great daily styling tool, drying my damp hair in just a few minutes (Caveat: I have fine, medium length hair, so someone with longer or thicker hair might need something more heavy duty).<br /><br />My only complaint about this dryer is that it's kind of loud. Granted, it is still an improvement over my old Sunbeam blow dryer, which sounded like demons being released from the bowels of Hell when I turned it on. With the Remington, I find that wearing earplugs reduces the noise to an acceptable level.

I loved the Solano, but I wanted to see if a significantly less expensive dryer would work as well.  The good news is, it dries just fine.  The bad news is that the concentrator attachment (there are three attachments - I use the narrow concentrator every day for straightening) is unnecessarily difficult to attach.  For the first couple of months, it took a great deal of effort and force to get the concentrator nozzle attached.  I had to twist and turn and manuever it every which way.  Even when I managed to get it on, it was easy to knock it off during the course of drying my hair.  I had to wait a minute or two to reattach it because the nozzle was too hot to handle.  When it cooled down sufficiently, the twisting and turning began anew.  When this happened numerous times during one attempt to dry my hair, it got pretty frustrating.<br />As others have noted, the thin chrome finish of the dryer chips off very easily, particularly when using the attachments.  After having owned this for about two months, the chrome is completely chipped off (the dryer has a matte black finish underneath the chrome) where the concentrator attaches.  It doesn't look great, but I don't have to worry anymore about brushing chrome flakes off my clothes every morning.<br />Over the past week, it's gotten much easier to get the concentrator attached, and it's less prone to fall off.  I assume it just took a couple of months to stretch.<br /><br />Update 11/9/10: The attachment no longer will stay on the dryer.

I then let my hair air dry for about 10 minutes while I putzed around the house.  3). I sectioned my hair and clipped up any hair I was not blow drying at the time.    4). On each section I was drying I put a tiny dot of straightening cream and worked it through my hair.  5). Using a 1.25 round natural bristle brush, I blew each section dry with a downward motion of the brush and dryer.  As I was done with each section, I clipped it away and worked with one section at a time.  It got a little awkward in the back, but I figured I would touch up with the flat iron at the end.  6). There was no need for touching up!  My hair came out great.  I used a dollop of shine wax when I was done drying and shaped my hair.  I finished with a spritz of hair spray.      Even if this hair dryer broke after one use, I would shell out the cash to get another one.  It is that worth it.  I did not have any problems with the buttons that some people said and I did not think it was too heavy to work with either.  What can I say?  I love this hair dryer and I would give it 10 stars!",8/5/2010,5,5.0

I use hot rollers and my hair is thin so I have to be careful with products left on hair weighing it down.  Even with the regular hair spray my hair would look like helmot head..and would fall before I even went outside.  Outside, in the sun, would cake.    Anyway I read that the Sebastian products were amazing. So with high hopes I purcahsed the re-shaper with the mindset you could finger thorugh, etc.    I even went as far as spraying each section before I hot rolled it for the layered in hold.  Then spritzed all over when done.  Today, after I did this I had amazing curls, etc..  Didnt even leave the house just went into the other room which is my office.  IT is air conditioned so have not been outside yet.  The door bell rang less than 20minutes and I passed by the mirror and the hair has completely FALLEN!  This is after I layered every curl and sprayed entire head with re-shaper as a finisher.    What a disappointment.  My hair is sticky too.  Im not sure why the other poster said it stayed great even after finger combing.  Maybe because it was just a few hairs on her head (bangs).    My hair has fallen and left with the feeling of hair spray on my hair.      So, not sure what the hype was all about. I have never used hair spray so much and it did nothing.

I get so tired of trying out skincare products made for combination skin (normal/oily). Face creams for dry skin is just too much moisture and oil for my type of skin. Finding good all natural skincare is even harder. I use Pangea Organics line for the day time. I use this oil for night because I wake up with very oily and very dry skin. Using this actually helps reduce this and makes my skin feel so much softer. It's hard for me blend this oil on my face alone without using more than 2 drops. So, I mix this in with my Pangea Organics face lotion at night and wake up with refreshed-looking skin. I haven't tried using this oil in the day time since I get the midday oil slick, but I hear Argan Oil reduces the oiliness without drying the skin. Here's another bonus, my skin tend to get flushed in the afternoon, like as if I just ran a marathon. Using this Argan Oil reduced the redness.     One of the reviewer says it might not be pure because it is fragrance free, instead will try one that has the fragrance. I don't doubt this is product is of lesser quality because the information supplied by Slice of Nature says that there are 3 processing types for Argan oil. One of them is make Argan oil fragrance free and most of the time comes out clear. The other type of processing keeps the fragrance and the color is yellow or darker AND it is mostly used for cooking, maybe for cosmetics. I personally don't want to put cooking oil on my skin, since cooking oil can go rancid very quickly. That's like saying that I will put grapeseed cooking oil for my body. Would you do this? This one from Watt's Beauty is clear and it is contained in a very simple and plain brown bottle with a dropper, which is very useful.     As always with any consumer products, it's always either you like it or you don't. I personally like this and will continue to use it.    I haven't tried using this on my hair or on my body.

I had tried my razor with the factory Merkur blade, and I got a half-decent shave, but I had to be very careful because the blade would randomly dig into my skin. I switched to Derby, and what a difference a Derby makes.<br /><br />The blades are very sharp- my wife tested them gently dry-shaving a bit of leg hair, and they left an instant bald spot. However, they're not too sharp as some people have said a Feather blade can be- I can even press down on my razor just a bit in trouble areas to get really close results, and not have to worry too much about slicing myself open.<br /><br />If you're just starting out with double edge shaving, do yourself a favor and pick up some Derby blades. The only reason I'll consider switching potentially to find a razor with more economical packaging. Derby blades come in little plastic mini-tubs that are individually wrapped, not to mention the blades are also individually wrapped. I would prefer to be a touch more environmentally conscious and get a paper sleeve full of razors instead of six plastic boxes.<br /><br />When packaging is your biggest concern about a product, you know there's good product in there.

I personally think it does a better job on the genital area than on the bikini area.  It really makes a difference at what angles your hair grows, and if your hair is on the smoother side and grows very parallel to your skin (like it does on the areas that would show right around my bikini line), it's tough to get it all with this shaver.  It does a good job on the more coarse hair in more intimate areas, as those stand at more of a perpendicular angle (especially when they're short and stubbly after having been shaved a few days before).    You will have to pull gently at your skin and/or hold it in a kind of pinched way sometimes to make sure you get all of the hairs at an angle the shaver will reach, but none of that is painful and it does work.  You'll also have to go over each area more than once, so plan on devoting a few minutes to the process (more than that for your first time or two), because you won't be able to get it all super quickly with the multiple runs over areas and the need to stretch and pull your skin.  I haven't really had any experiences of it pinching or nicking my skin.  Do use some sort of baby powder, particularly in damper areas to make the skin dry and easy to run the shaver over.    I use a compressed air can, along with the little cleaning brush that comes with it, to clean it after each use.  I don't think the brush does a thorough job on its own.    Overall I'm quite happy with this product and would recommend it as a worthwhile purchase.  I have to use it pretty much every day to stay truly smooth, and there are a couple tiny areas that I tend to run a razor over (going in the same direction as the hair so it won't create razor burn) after using the shaver just because the hair in those places isn't at enough of an angle for the shaver to really reach.  You would definitely need to use a trimmer to get the hair to a short stubble before using this shaver; I opted for actually shaving everything with a razor first, and then using the shaver to shave the stubble once it started growing back a day or two later, and have continued doing that stubble maintenance ever since.    The battery life is also pretty good.  I've had the razor for about six months now and have changed the batteries only once so far, probably a couple of months in, while using it every few days.",8/5/2010,4,4.0

The Oral-B only has an on and off function, so there is no calming down the motor in it. The floss action was just to hard on my teeth. I am a young guy, but i am just so blessed with sensitive teeth. So i decided to purchase this through amazon since this was the best price around. When i got it i went home after work and tried it out. Wow what a difference between this and the floss action, as well as just a manual toothbrush.

The colors are buildable (you can easily add more to any look), but they go on VERY sheer. They are meant more for enhancing natural lip color than for actually changing their color, and touch ups are necessary after just an hour or two. If you choose to purchase this product, I recommend buying a lip stick primer that will prolong the color for awhile. As I said, they are very sheer, so if you are looking more for a rich lipstick shade than just a tinted gloss, I suggested not throwing away your $18. You will be very unhappy.

I never leave home without mascara (yeah, okay, and a little lipgloss, too. I'm vain). I found so much FREEDOM in using this product!  I can now go to the water park, the pool, the beach, etc and actually have noticeable eyes without having to bother with waterproof mascara (that destroys your lashes anyway).    It was easy & fast to use -- start to finish, including clean up, it took maybe 10 minutes. If it's messy for you, you're using too much of the gel at one time. The trick is to make sure you use the 1st chemical several times and allow it to soak through the hair's cuticle. Once that's done, it's just a matter of barely touching your lashes with the colorant gel and presto! Dark lashes!      Ladies, it only COLORS your existing lashes, it doesn't make them longer or thicker.  If you take your time and apply it carefully, you can get it to go from the base to the tips of your lashes.  I colored my lashes about 3 weeks ago, and it's still going strong.  I'll probably do a touch up in another week or so. I'm very happy with this product. I wish I'd found it 20 years ago.

R1F3CEXZ3EQ864,14310848,958001477,4,24,N,True,25,A peel one can use weekly for maintenance...,"I purchased this peel because I wanted something that might help to fade any small freckles/sun spots developing on my face, as well as fade small wrinkles near my eyes. I am Asian, with a medium-light complexion that is already fairly wrinkle and acne-free; but I was starting to see more melanin spots on my face developing, as I didn't start using sunscreen on my face daily until age 30 (I am now 35). However, my skin does tend to be oily in the T-zone, and I would still get an occasional pimple on my forehead or under my cheekbones on a regular basis.     After using this product, I noticed that my already scarce breakouts became practically non-existent, and though some of the small freckles on my upper cheeks haven't faded much, my skin does feel and look smoother and clearer. I don't use concealer, powder, or foundation (I can't stand the look and feel of it on my skin), and only use Shiseido SPF 55 for the face on a daily basis, but this seems to be all I need to still look pretty flawless, which I attribute to some of the peel's effects. I originally only used the 35% glycolic acid peel sold by the same company, but decided to try this lactic acid/glycolic acid combination to see if it would have a different or stronger effect (it does sting/tingle more than the 35% glycolic acid peel alone). I usually use this product every 7 days, and leave the solution on for a full 10 minutes (it stings and tingles, but this doesn't bother me much; leaving it on this long doesn't cause any hot spots on my skin, either, but my skin is pretty resistant to a lot of environmental insults). I also notice that small blackheads and sebaceous plugs in my forehead and nose will loosen easily and can be pushed or exfoliated out more easily after using this peel.     Overall, I think this is a good maintenance peel for those who want to slow (or possibly even reverse) the subtle signs of aging, i.e. development of melanin pigmentation from sun exposure, smoothing the surface of the epidermis, possibly neutralizing fine lines, and decreasing acne. I will likely continue using this product, until I become adventurous enough to perhaps try something different and stronger (i.e. a 70% Lactic Acid peel). The price is right, too, and won't cost you the overhead you might pay for having the same type of peel done at a medi-spa.",8/5/2010,4,4.0

It feels like you just had your teeth cleaned every time you brush!  Up until amazon started carrying the product you had no option but to buy it at the dentist office with their marked up price.  Now, with the price cut in half, I could afford 2 of these for everyone in the house.<br /><br />The sterilization chamber holds 2 brusheads of either size and angles them towards a sanitation UV lamp (254 nm) - the cycle runs 15 minutes which is sufficient to kill anything on the bristles after use.  I've had my brushes over a year now and still am using the origianl lamp.  You get two indications that it is working, a flashing led above which goes steady once the process is finished and the chamber has not been opened (then it goes out) - plus the philips logo lights up from the UV inside but blocks the harmful rays from escaping by flourescing in the UV glow of the lamp.<br /><br />This is a good system for children, as it has reminder buzzes on when to move on to the next set of teeth, and has 5 different cycles from gentile to vigorous.  My dentist recommended it to me, and I recommend it to anyone who doesnt't want to see their dentist as often!<br /><br />Positives:  It charges using an induction charger - meaning there are no exposed wires.  A coil hides behind the charging station and a second coil is inside the toothbrush.  When they are in close proximity (2) they couple energy from the AC line to the brush under charge.  This is a safe method of charging and does not require cords to plug into the brush.<br /><br />Negatives:  The system has one li-ion battery.  Once it expires, philips provides a mechanism to use a screwdriver to remove the battery before throwing away the toothbrush, thus guaranteeing you will buy another one.  It would have been as easy to put a cap on the bottom allowing you to replace the expired battery at that time and then continue to use the brush electronics, which are very robust.<br /><br />Of all power toothbrushes, this is the most efficient and professional.

RXSCBY79LV7MN,52660953,197856712,4,92,N,True,98,Nice features for a hangup hair dryer,"Traveling on business often allowed me to try quite a few hotel hair dryers over the years.  The features I like about the Andis hair dryers I've used were that they were not too large or heavy, they had medium heat to medium-high heat, they didn't blow too hard, and they were relatively quite.  I've used some hair dryers that almost gave me wrist strain trying to hold them, and some that caused your ears to ring once your hair was dry.  The Andis' hangup models seem to find a good compromise between function and low noise levels. I've put these in all our bathrooms at home, since they can be used without disturbing others in the house even if they are sleeping.  Some different models of Andis dryers I've owned before would stop working after about a year due to a diode on the on/off switch overheating and failing, but this model doesn't seem to have that issue.  Other nice features that this 30975/HD-10L has are that there is no GFI transformer plug at the end of the cord...It's built into the base housing of the dryer.  Also, this unit comes with a cord hang-up bracket which can be placed on either side of the base. Like other hair dryers the on/off switch will reset to the off position when it's placed back into the base wall holder. Taking the dryer out of the base again will resume the flow of warm air. Some reviewers have complained of the brightness of the built-in nightlight. It's not annoying to me and it can be use it as the only nightlight in the bathroom. If I could ask for only one additional feature, it would be a way to change the color of the LED light.  There are many LED nightlights on the market that let you select what color you'd like the light to have, and lock it to that color.  This would be a nice feature to have on this unit, and might please those that think the light is too bright.  Last, this unit has a metal wall bracket and paper template, so it's actually very easy to install. The plastic base then screws to the metal plate, once mounted, with two small screws hidden by the hair dryer when it's in the base. Any excess cord can be hidden inside the base, so between not having an unsightly GFI box on the plug end and the fact that you can shorten the cord to just a few inches, if needed, makes for a very clean installation. No cords unsightly tangled cords hanging around your bath to get caught on other stuff.  And not having the GFI plug allows other appliances like cordless tooth brushes, shavers, or rollers to be used on the same wall outlet without the adjacent plug(s) being blocked.ted, with two small screws hidden by the hair dryer when it's in the base.

When I got home, I found this one on Amazon and ordered it. I love this hair dryer! I use it all the time - not just when traveling. It's light-weight so my arms don't get tired, and it blow dries my short haircut very quickly - about 5 mins with styling. I also like that it doesn't have that long blower on it which is harder for me to use for some reason. I saw the review about it not working right in Spain, but I was very pleased with how it worked in Greece. There is a screwlike switch you have to turn for European voltage and I wonder if the previous reviewer did not realize this? When the hair dryer is set to European voltage, there is only one speed (high), instead of the usual high and low, and I was pleasantly surprised that the hair dryer worked perfectly in Greece, just as it did at home - same strength and heat. The only maintenance was to clean the filter with an old toothbrush once in awhile as it would get covered with lint from hair products I use and then the dryer would overheat - but this is something I have to do with any hairdryer I purchase. After being used everyday for about three years, it's starting to sound as if the motor is going and so I'm back to buy another one. My daughter tried mine and liked it so much, she got one also. We both prefer this hairdryer to many other more expensive ones we've tried through the years. I highly recommend this hairdryer!",5/30/2010,5,5.0

The dryer is much much lighter than what I'm used to and has a nice smooth feel (as in, it doesn't feel light plastic under my hands, but more of a rubbery-feel - very pleasant!).  It is also just as powerful as the 213x.  It has 2 speeds (gale-force wind and normal), and 3 heat settings.  I use the gale-force winds on medium heat and my hair 4-5 below my shoulder, thin-medium thickness, is dry in under 3 minutes.  My younger sister tried it out and put it on gale-force high heat and she said it didn't stay on for more than a few seconds.  My thoughts are it could have been my outlet (I live in a very old apartment building - circa 1900s) unable to handle the current flow OR it could have been a safety feature of the hair dryer to prevent over-heating.

I have several skin tags on my neck and applied product carefully with a q-tip as directed. It has a stinging sensation on application so I was careful not to apply too much solution to the tags. I got some of the solution on the surrounding skin but applied the ointment to stop the burn. The solution burns the skin very quickly so you have to be carefuly not to apply too much. The burns has caused my skin to become discolored, my neck now looks worse than before and my tags haven't fallen off yet. That was a week ago, so I will now use a small brush to apply and hopefully this will prove a better applicator than the q-tip. I am now looking forward to be rid of the tags and acid burns on my neck.    If you are interested in purchasing this product, please proceed with caution. Maybe the suppliers could provide a small applicator with this purchase.",3/11/2010,3,3.0

Recently, the bulbs went out and I discovered that there's no easy way to replace them, so it seemed worth it to just buy a new mirror.  Actually, this one is a little bit better.  I think that lighting technology has changed a bit since I last bought it and the lever that changes the lighting is smoother.  My last one became very difficult to move and it eventually broke off every time I tried to move it.<br /><br />All in all, the option to change the lighting is fantastic and it gives off plenty of light to be able to do my makeup in low light situations.

I have the Advance handle and Philips no longer makes replacement heads for the Advance handles but instead has a slightly different head called e-series that is supposed to fit the Advance handle.  I ordered the three pack of the e-series and it does fit the original Advance handle but be advised that he makes a louder noise when in use.  Apparently, the magnets on the e-series' don't match what was originally designed for the Advance handles.  I called Philips and demonstrated the noise difference over the phone to the technician and even she could tell the significant difference in noise.  It's not unbareable by any stretch but is not as comfortable as using the old replacement heads.  The technician did not know about the difference in noise, checked with others and then got back to me that, yes, there is a difference in noise.  Philips should tell the user about this difference.  It's no big deal, but should be disclosed.<br /><br />What I found interesting also is that the new package says to replace the heads every 3 months.  The old packaging said every 6 months.  When I asked the technician about this and asked if this meant that the new heads were not made as well as the old heads and was this part of the American corporate conspiracy to have consumers buy more and spend more, she said they changed the recommendation on the advice of dental professionals.  Whether these dental professionals are part of the conspiracy, I do not know.  Whether the new heads are not as well built as the old, I also don't know.  But in any event, since I've been using the Sonicare for the past 15 years or so I've changed heads every six months or so and my teeth have not fallen out and I've had no complaints from my dentist.  I guess I'll update this review four months from now and advise whether my teeth have fallen out and are full of cavities all because I didn't change the replacement head after three months.<br /><br />But to Philips credit, at least they didn't simply stop making a head to fit the Advance handle and thereby force the consumer to buy a new handle for the new heads.

I have it out at the barn with my horse and use it it dry him off after a workout and a bath.  This means that while it is only working on short hair, it has a lot of surface area to cover and it holds up the whole time.

R3J92AO7VQBCGS,14315031,197856712,5,1,N,True,1,In regard to other reviews,"I originally bought this model hangup hair dryer because of the cord hanger. In all honesty, I never use the hanger. I leave my cord dangle. It actually helps to detract from the power cord that runs to the outlet. If I hang the cord, I actually feel like that just spreads out the cord mess. That may be something to consider if you are buying this model for the cord hanger.    The nighlight is not as bright as some of these reviews would have you believe. If you go from having a completely dark bathroom to having this light, you will notice the room is much brighter at night, but the light is no brighter than any other night light.    You will need the right size allen wrench to switch the dryer from 1200W to 1600W as this does not come with the dryer.     I had no problems with the screw length for mounting as others have stated, so they may have fixed that problem.    This dryer is much quiter than my previous dryer which was an 1875W regular handheld model. It's not silent, but it is quieter than any dryer I've owned.    Even though this and other wall mounted dryers have lower wattage, I don't notice a significate increase in drying time (maybe a minute or two). I actually prefer the lower wattage now because I'm not blasting my hair (or scalp!) with heat which tended to cause split ends and fry my hair after continued use (I don't curl or use a flat iron, so the difference is purely a result of the hair dryers). Also, once I finish blow drying, my hair looks like it will for the rest of the day (an moderate amount of volume), whereas with the 1875W dryer, my hair would be a pouf ball first thing in the morning and gradually flatten to my head by the end of the day.     Other notes: The dryer itself is a medium size. I like that it's not one of the tiny ones because I feel like it's not flimsy and weak (even if smaller ones really aren't). It's also not as big and heavy as full sized dryers, so I find that I move it around much more and get more even drying.",3/9/2010,5,5.0

With the limited space in our bathroom after moving, the hair dryer took up more space than was warranted for it.

After a few trips where the hotel had a wall mounted hair dryer that suited my need just fine, I talked the hubby into putting out the funds for a wall mounted dryer.  I hemmed and hawed about which dryer I should buy.  Mostly, it came down to price and the loop for the cord.

The loop on the back is flat and not a circle so you have to hook the cord over it just like in the picture.  I had expected it to be a full circle sticking out from the wall, but it sits flush.

It's a no brainer!  Dragging out the hairdryer every day and trying to put it away neatly is a hassle and there is no reason to put up with it any longer!  I bought 2 Oster 76932-710 and put one up in my bathroom and the other in the spare bath.  Now when guests come over they compliment me for the nice hotel upgrade.  Everybody comments on what a good idea.    The 710 watt Oster is a great dryer and does the job well on my thick hair.  The dryer snaps easily in and out of the holder.  It took me about 30 minutes to install both dryers...and that included the time it took me to find my drill and try and read 3/16 on the drill bit!

Cord gives enough to stretch down low when I blow dry my daughters hair.  Only negative is that there is no heat control.  High air setting has high heat.  Medium air has medium heat.  Low air has luke warm heat.  But since I prefer the high air/high heat it works ok for me.  I recommend it.<br /><br />UPDATE12/2012:  Around the beginning of 2012 the unit's high setting stopped working.  Or rather it works intermittently.  Sometimes it will come on but most times it does not.  This makes it hard to dry thick or long hair.  The heat & air volume on the other settings doesn't cut it if you want to dry your hair quickly or if you have a lot of hair.

I didn't think much about it other than realizing I'd probably need to replace it soon.  Then this morning as I was drying my hair, I happened to see it in the mirror as it slowed down.  It was throwing sparks when it slowed!  I was lucky my hair hadn't caught fire!

I won't buy a dryer without high/med/low heat and high/low speed which this one has, because I do my hair both curly and straight.  I like that it comes with a concentrator and diffuser, because it is sometimes hard to fit aftermarket attachments.  The filter is easy to remove and clean It also isn't too heavy.  The color is cute, although I don't know if most men would like it.<br /><br />On using it, it has good power, and it's not too noisy.  It also doesn't get hot anywhere but on the very tip by the metal grate, and even that's not bad.  If you are a stylist who likes to hold the barrel of the dryer, this is totally doable.  And it's cool enough to put away immediately after use instead of leaving it to cool, which is especially nice.  The cord is a good length.<br /><br />The retractable cord is definitely a nice feature, but should be done two-handed, guiding the cord so it doesn't come up and hit your hand or arm (I tried it, OUCH!).  It's a tad tricky because the button is small and slightly awkward to get to one-handed.<br /><br />All that said, I have two issues with this product.  The first is minor... there is no loop or hook to hang the thing up!  I keep my dryer on a hook inside the door or my bathroom vanity cabinet, and it's an annoyance that I can't hang this there.  And because the cord is retractable, you can't really loop it around the barrel and hang it with that without negating that feature.<br /><br />The second issue is more significant.  I am no engineer, but in my lay opinion, this dryer has WAY too much vibration.  It gives my hand a bit of a workout while holding it.  I can't say whether this is a problem will this model, or just for some reason the one that I was sent.  But it is significant, and it is still happening after 10 or so uses.<br /><br />This dryer is nice, but without understanding specifically the benefits of ionic, tourmaline etc., I don't see anything that makes it better than any other dryer with those same essential features I mentioned at the beginning.

I have to completely and forcefully dry it in order to tame it down.  I've bought dozens of blow dryers in my lifetime to battle my hair, most from the drugstore.  Despite having consistently mediocre-to-poor experiences with these cheapies, I stupidly found myself continuing to buy them.  I have no fewer than 4 unused Conairs relegated to the hall closet because they don't perform acceptably.  And that's in addition to the countless ones that I've thrown away when they broke.      So I finally decided to change tactics and buy a higher end model.  My hair stylist recommended the Elchim brand, as that's what they use in the salon I go to (Vidal Sassoon salon).  It's definitely a step up from the Conair, but there are some things I don't love about it.    Things I Like:  -Good, strong air flow  -Feels Solid - plastic feels strong and not flimsy.  I've only had it for a few weeks, so it remains to be seen how durable it is compared to the drugstore cheapies, but it feels like it won't break as quickly.  -Long cord so you can move around as needed  -3 settings each for air flow and heat    Things I Don't Like:  -Hottest setting is extremely hot.  I burned my finger by touching MY HAIR after drying a lock on the hottest setting!  Unfortunately, the medium setting isn't quite hot enough.  So I've been using the hottest setting and moving it around fast so it doesn't heat up one area long enough to fry my hair or my fingers.  It's tiring and I'm hoping it doesn't damage my hair long term.  -No cool shot.    Overall, seems like a step up from the cheap drugstore dryers because the air flow is much better and it feels more durable (we'll see if that proves true over time), but for some people it might not be worth paying twice as much.",8/24/2009,4,4.0

It's been used for 5 to 10 minutes every other day for the past couple months and so far not a problem at all. There is only one tiny design complaint I have, and that is I figured the retractable cord would be completely hidden when fully retracted but theres a stopper which allows a good 10 inches of chord to remain...I wouldve preferred it to retract completely to the plug, but fine. I expected something different and this is what I got, so four and a half stars. Otherwise, so far a great product for the unbeatable price. For its size it dries fairly quickly, and does indeed fold up into a nice little package (however you'll end up winding the rest of the chord around it anyway). And the folding handle makes a fair amount of cracking noise when you fold it...not the smoothest mechanism, but fine. Once again, not perfect, but for size it's as good as it gets.<br />UPDATE: It's now been a good 12 months or so, and the usage has gone up to 5-10 minutes almost every day. It's fallen off the counter 3 to 4 times, and still works like a charm. The other day (now about 6 months ago) however, the button to retract the cord flew off (with spring) while the cord was furiously being pulled out.

Sure it weighed about 10 pounds and didn't have a concentrator-nozzle, but it was built to endure. The Oster dryer fit into a stand and had an optional plastic hood that would go over your head to dry your curlerd hair. Those were the days!<br /><br />I have owned maybe 15-20 dryers so far. They last a year and then they go pop and die.....usually at the worst time imaginanble, but that's a complelety different story.<br /><br />About a year ago, I read a review in Allure Magazine about the Bespoke Labs Tourmaline Dryer. The T3 model Allure claimed, dried your hair 60% faster, didn't dry out the hair shaft and left your hair luminous and fabulous. Just like a movie star.<br /><br />Being in the market for another dryer, I decided to invest in the Allure recommendation. It was about 3x more expensive than the crappy dryers I was used to but if it made my hair better it would be worth it.

Even if you use the dryer for a length of time, it doesn't get hotter.<br />-It is relatively quiet.<br />-There is a mesh screen that you can remove and clean so the inner workings don't get gunked up.<br />-It comes with a nozzle that is easy to rotate.<br />- There are no open ports that may suck in your hair. Gosh don't you hate getting your hair stuck in your dryer?<br />-The cord is a good, generous length, 114 for even the most out of the way electric outlets and there is a handy velcro strap for binding the cord into a neat package. Also thoughtful, a loop has been provided should you want to hang the dryer on the back of your bathroom door.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-There are two settings. The high setting is way too hot to use! Unless you have asbestos hair.<br />-The handle is very short. The on/off rocker switch and cool shot switch are just where I want to keep my fingers. I am constantly accidently pressing the off button while I am moving the dryer. This is very irritating. This is my biggest gripe with the dryer.<br />-I don't see much of a difference in the frizz department. I purchased the optional diffuser and my hair seems to be as frizzy as ever, tourmaline or not.<br />-My hair is still not luminous and movie star perfect.

I dried my hair no more than once a week for that reason, but I can't wait to use it every time, if I keep getting these results.

The bristles just squish out and do not stay stiff enough to work hair. I think the boars bristles would be even worse with thick hair. They need a stiff nylon brush option.  They also need a medium speed for drying. You get slow low and fast high and if you can hold your finger on the quick heat button then maybe you can get to medium heat and blowing speed from the low setting but you can't hold the button for long.

My hair is thick, with a wave, and it absolutely mushrooms after blowdrying or in high humidity. It takes forever to dry my hair, so naturally your weary arms tick up the heat factor to get it DRY already, and that in turn ups the frizz factor.    I must say, I was impressed. The dryer features several heat and style settings, so to give an honest portrayal of the results, I kept the heat on the equivalent settings as my usual blow dryer. Then, after a while when my arms would usually get tired, I increased the volume setting.    Unfortunately, with this blow dryer, I wasn't faking the exhaustion in my arms. This isn't the heaviest blow dryer I've ever used, but it's up there! If there was such a thing as getting muscled from using blow dryers, I'd be Ahnold already. I wasn't faking it when I reached the point in the blow drying when my arms were saying, Enough already!    The dryer is more than enough power to accomplish the job. What was interesting was after my hair was dry, it really WAS less frizzy than the same routine done with my usual blower dryer.    The second time I tried it, it was raining out and about a billion percent humidity, the perfect laboratory for determining if all the tourmaline/titanium/ceramic add-ons actually worked to keep hair smooth.    It kind of did. What I can say was my hair frizzed, but it frizzed LESS, and it was much shinier than I've ever seen my hair in humid weather. I guess that's an endorsement, but not enough of one where one might forgo a flat iron to flatten out the kinks.     The dryer comes with a diffuser, which I've always found to be WAY too much work and time (if your arms hurt with regular blow drying, you'll be crippled when you're done using a diffuser on thick hair!)    If you're in the market for a blow dryer, and you have a problem with the frizzes, you might want to give the Remington serious consideration. It did a nice job for me, but the gold standard - not having to use a flat iron - remains elusive, even with this dryer.",5/14/2009,3,3.0

After using it every day for about 8 days, I noticed a strange smell, but didn't know what it was. (It didn't smell like burning hair, more like home perm solution.) I switched from high heat (which had been fine with my Conair) to the medium setting, and the smell went away, but the damage continued. I have medium length fine straight hair, and the ends became dry and frizzy and began to break off. After a month, my hair has turned to brittle straw, won't curl, and is breaking all over.  Also, I color my hair with semi-permanent coloring, and the now frizzy ends absorb more of the coloring, giving a strange look. I realize now that this dryer was working so quickly because it was WAY too hot, even on the medium setting. Not sure if the ions were a factor, but it doesn't matter. After reading the other reviews here, I feel lucky not to have experienced sparks or flames. I'm getting a short cut and a new dryer and waiting for my hair to grow out. I'm extremely upset, and definitely will not purchase another Revlon product.",3/22/2009,2,2.0

I've used wall-mounted hairdryers in hotels and thought that it would be the solution for me.    Wrong!  While it's great to have it up on the wall and out of the way, the small size makes it better suited to short hair.  With longer hair you have to be careful to hold the dryer farther away from your head so that hair doesn't get sucked into the back of it.  I believe this is what caused my hairdryer to start overheating after just two months of use.  The fan became very sluggish and the coils would overheat, then it would spark and the thermostat would reset.  The fan would speed up within a few minutes to where it could keep the coils from overheating, but eventually this took even longer.  I took it apart to clean it but it is made in such a way that you can't get at the hair that is wrapped around the fan stem.  I could see that it was only a few strands anyway, but even this was too much.    Even when it was new it didn't blow a lot of air, though it did get fairly hot.  I'm off to buy a full size hairdryer with more power and will just have to figure out a place to hang it.  Blah.      p.s.  The nightlight is really, really bright.

(The cheap mass-market hair dryers started getting this backwards around the time they all transitioned from squirrel-cage fans to radial fans. Heating-element wire is cheaper than decent fans motors, I guess; and if that turns a hair dryer into a blowtorch, so what -- people who don't know any better will buy them anyway.)    This particular unit has a very long round cord. I can't vouch for the cord's durability, but I see no reason it wouldn't hold up. Even if it were fragile, though, I'd still want to own this hair dryer. Cords are easy to replace. I've put two on my massive GE steam iron, an old-timer from the 1960s.    In summary, then, this dryer is tough, heavy, quiet, comfortable, extraordinarily effective, and obviously built for the long haul. It is far, far above anything I've seen in the stores since squirrel-cage motors disappeared some years ago.",6/15/2008,5,5.0

This is my third hair dryer with a cord reel, which I find convenient.  The first one was OK and worked well, but was noisy.  My second one ([[ASIN:B000BFJJ7E Conair 1875 Watt Ionic Cord Keeper Hair Dryer]]), which I used for only a couple months, was also noisy.  The cord in it was also too short (4 feet) and when retracting it, rewound so quickly that the plug would whip around and hit me painfully in the hand.  I had to be careful about how to hold it when retracting the cord.  It also had only fast/hot and slow/warm settings.  I got fed up with it, so I looked for new options at a local Target.  I found this dryer and was hesitant to pay twice as much for it as I did the previous ones.  I couldn't imagine what could be special enough about it to justify two and a half times the cost.  When I tried it, I was quite surprised.  The first thing I noticed is that it is heavier and feels very solid and well built.  I don't care about the weight--it takes me only a minute or two to dry my medium-length (for a man) hair.  The next surprise was that it is extremely quiet--even at high speed.  I no longer have to turn up my radio to hear the news while drying my hair.  It has independent controls for heat and speed.  I usually like to use high heat with the low speed so it doesn't blow my hair so much.  The 5-foot cord retracts slowly and safely and is just the perfect length for my situation.  I would not describe the quietness of the dryer as slightly better than the cheaper driers I have used before--it is a dramatic difference.  I have often wondered about the potential hearing loss my old dryers might cause, but didn't worry too much because it didn't take very long to dry my hair.  If I still had long hair, I would be seriously concerned about the noise from a cheap dryer.  As for how well my hair looks after using it, I notice no difference from the other dryers.  My hair if very fineand thick with some wave, so it is pretty easy to care for.  It will frizz in high humidity, but I live in Denver and humidity is not a problem here.  I have not tried this in a humid environment.  I highly recommend this dryer.  Update on 2010-10-17: This dryer is still working great and I still consider it the best dryer I've ever used.

From the very first day she used this thing, she started getting compliments about her hair. Her hair is normally pretty straight and flat, and it definitely had more body.  It was also less frizzy after she got done drying it for whatever that's worth. The compliments are fading now that her coworkers are used to the new look, but my wife is still raving about it.<br /><br />I purchased this for her because I got tired of repairing or replacing all of the crappy ones she bought over the years. The latest one I put to rest dimmed all of the lights in the house when it was coming online. She and I needed a change. I read all of the good reviews on Amazon, and elsewhere, and gave it a shot.<br /><br />The Elchim is everything I hoped for in a hairdryer. The first thing my wife and I both noticed was that it was MUCH quieter than any hair dryer she had ever used. Its highest setting is equivalent to most hair dryers' lowest setting.  We can actually hold a conversation now if we need to while she dries her hair. I figured it was up to my wife to protect her own hearing, but I was very concerned when she dried my daughter's hair.  It definitely defeats the myth that louder is better or more powerful.<br /><br />Secondly, the quieter airflow was very powerful. 1500 liters/minute is the claim. I haven't ever seen another volume measurement, but it sounds impressive, right? Anyway, as others have stated, my wife dried her hair in about half of the time that it took her normally. She thought I was nuts when I showed it to her and it did not sound like a fighter jet, but she was pleasantly surprised. It has a removable filter screen (twist-off) on the end to keep the airflow at its peak which will prove invaluable over time. The buildup of hairspray, makeup, lint, and whatever else will be easy to remove without completely disassembling it. This congealed mess has contributed to the deaths of other hair dryers in the past.<br /><br />Elchim is a professional brand and they build their products for heavy-duty use. It has a thick round cord, which will be much less prone to tangling. It is smaller than almost every full size hair dryer she has owned.  It has a sleek design as opposed to the ones with the cylinder sticking out the side to house the motor. This will prove great for packing. I expect it to last for years.<br /><br />I read many mixed reviews about the ionic dryers, Tourmaline, ceramic heating elements, EMF, etc., but none swayed me away from common sense. See below:<br /><br />The ionic dryers are supposed to trap moisture in your hair. A few things on that: Moisture = weight. Weight = flat. Conditioners are still the best thing to protect your hair and give it shine without weighing it down. Many use wax, which is much lighter than water and gives body and shine without weighing the hair down.<br /><br />There are also claims about breaking down the water molecules to smaller sizes. Science note: Breaking down a molecule of water (H2O) leaves hydrogen peroxide (HO) and a free hydrogen atom (H). We now have that answer for fuel cell cars and bleach blondes, right? Ionic dryers don't heat the air, they heat the hair from within. Isn't that what microwaves do? There are good Ionic dryers out there, but be wary of the claims. Some people claim that ionic dryers also cause dry eyes and headaches. I did not see a need to risk anything like that.<br /><br />Last thing about ionic dryers, the cheaper ones use technology in which the ionizer does not last. A good ionic dryer will cost you more than the $29.95 delivered! versions. Read the reviews, none of the 5-star reviews for the cheaper ones is after extended use. Many of the lowest reviews complain about inconsistency, lack of performance, and breaking down altogether. If you want a good ionic dryer, be prepared to spend a little. If the cheapies were the answer, they would be in use in the salons.<br /><br />Bottom line: Your hearing matters; protect it.  Proven technology matters; ignore the hype about trapping moisture in the hair you are trying to dry. Ergonomics matter; pack-ability, weight, and hand comfort might make or break you on how you feel about your hair dryer. My wife's arrived in all black...so what. She never paraded one around in the past, and I don't expect her to anytime soon. They only make black, white, red, and red-black, no neon or orange surprises. There is no substitute for quality and durability. While you may not always get what you pay for, if you buy cheap things, the adage holds true.<br /><br />I researched these things thoroughly before I bought it and read several reviews where people were using their Elchim hair dryers for 10+ years. I have no doubt that this will follow those lines. Salons around the world use them several hours per day. Ours should last for years. Well worth the $60-ish I paid.<br /><br />*** Update - Feb 20, 2010 ***<br /><br />After about two years and NO abuse, the cord on my wife's hairdryer crapped the bed. What is weird is that it broke about three inches down from the rubber protector that goes into the handle. I expected any break would be at a bend where the protector ends or inside of the hairdryer where it is internally clamped. It broke where it should have never been an issue. I cut the cord about two inches from the solder points, where I thought the break would be, intending to solder back on. As it turned out, the intermittent wiring was about three to four inches further down from my original cut. When I dissected the failed portion, it looked like it had been accidentally crimped or kinked in the manufacturing process. I still hold that the hairdryer is top-notch. I will repair the cord on the next one I get, if I get the same model. Why do I need another one? Read on.<br /><br />For the guys out there saying no biggy, I can fix a cord, beware. For the record, this thing is a BEAST to disassemble and reassemble. Iwork with all sorts of electronics. When it originally failed, I opened up the hairdryer thinking the electrical problem was internal. Once I was inside, I saw the problem was not there. However, there were two wires in there that broke with little maneuvering and prove near impossible to repair. After reassembling the hairdryer, I could not get the screws seated well enough to feel safe when in the hands of my wife or daughter. I threw it out after MUCH frustration and solder. It did work when I got it back together, but the exposed screws in a wet environment caused me concern.<br /><br />I regret doing this because I was the person that posted the pictures of the cord and how it would never break. Alas, I was wrong. I think I will look for a newer/different model by the same manufacturer. I DID NOT contact Elchim to see how much a repair was. After shipping both ways, I'm sure it would have been up there with the cost of the dryer itself. I did email them a detailed description of the failure though. Nobody has replied to that letter. My wife hates the replacement dryer(tourmaline) and wants her Elchim back.<br /><br />For all those that I doubted: I'm stupid. You're smart. I was wrong. You were right. You're the best. I'm the worst. You're very good looking. I'm not attractive. (from Happy Gilmore) I thought about posting pictures of my failure, but what's the point. I edited a picture previously posted noting where the item eventually broke. Good electrician, possibly a good deal. I would change my star rating, but it would remove my review from the most helpful spot. If you read this far, you must have felt it was helpful too....or at least amusing?<br /><br />*** Update - December 2013 ***<br /><br />When the last one died (my fault) three years back, I didn't replace it because she had purchased a cheap stand-in while I wrongfully attempted to fix the cord. She simply kept using it after I killed the Elchim. I put up with screaming our morning conversations for longer than I should have waiting for the cheap jet engine to die. Well, it lives on, but my patience broke. I reluctantly coughed up the money for a new Elchim. Same model, just different color. OMG, it's so much nicer to not have to listen to that screaming menace in the morning. We can actually talk to each other if necessary while she dries her hair. She'll probably appreciate life more once she can heard birds singing again. I felt a bit stupid after I killed the first one, and I didn't want to augment that feeling by spending $$$ for a hair dryer when she already had a replacement. Now that I swallowed my pride and replaced the Elchim, everyone's happier...and I'm sure we hear a little better too.",3/27/2008,5,5.0

Size and weight are fine.  Noise level is fine.  I find the controls in a perfectly normal spot and I don't have trouble with them.  I don't think my hair dries any quicker than with my old dryer, but I do have less static flyaways.  My hair seems smooth and bouncy and healthy.  Not sure how much is due to the dryer.  The one strange thing is I couldn't find anywhere that said how many watts it has, and now I own it and still, none of the packing materials, box, insert or even the dryer itself says how many watts, which is odd.  But it has enough power for me (my old dryer had 1875).  For $40, its fine.  Had I paid the $259 supposed sticker price, I'd be disappointed.

The setting that this dryer has for low on the heat side would be about as hot I would normally dry my hair...but since there's no speed setting to choose from, I'd be in the bathroom for about an hour trying to get my hair dry.    The thing is a little clumsy to hold and the nozzle is just slightly bigger than a silver dollar so there's not even a LOT of air coming out of it.    I turned it on, used it for about 2 minutes, repacked it into the box and came out here to immediately begin the return process.    Save your money.

To use it I have to use the funneling head attachment, but there is almost no airflow on the low setting.

Did I receive the wrong hairdryer or something? For starters, how can the product description say lightweight??? This thing is so bulky and heavy!! And because it takes so long to dry my hair with this thing, the heaviness of it sure doesn't help. It's apparently 1800 watts, but it feels like it's half that. I'm giving it two stars because for one, it's incredibly quiet and I've never heard a dryer this quiet and two, my hair was a bit less frizzy than with my previous ionic dryer. But these two pros aren't worth the cons. I don't see anything special about this dryer and my mother's 1875 watt Conair dryer beats this any day.    Also, has anyone done any research on this product? Google it. Have you noticed that it isn't sold in any salons, on the Farouk website, or anywhere else where you can see it's original $259.95 price?? I believe this is a cheaper, dumbed down version of a quality, more expensive Farouk product that has been released at a cheaper price so that the company has a range of affordable to higher-end priced products to widen their consumer base and profits. Nothing wrong with that, but I'm just trying to say that this definitely isn't some $260 dollar amazing hairdryer. The whole deep brilliance line seems to be a cheaper, more affordable version of Farouk products that are being advertised as if they are more higher-end, originally higher priced items. I dunno, try and find it somewhere where it was originally $259.95 or even for any other price. I sure as hell couldn't find it.

When I first started using it, it worked great.  I was amazed at how quickly it dried my hair and how shiny it looked afterwards.  I have naturally curly hair and prefer it straight so I used this to dry it straight (along with a round brush) and it did the job amazingly well.<br /><br />Well I had this for a little over a year when all of a sudden one day it started shooting out some sparks.  I couldn't believe it.  I turned it on another day just to see if it even turned on and it did but you could see the coils in it started to get red and then shoot out some sparks.  This wasn't even overused or anything.  In fact since I was pregnant at the time I bought it, I had a hard time standing up for too long so I only used it once or twice a week.  After that little use it was already not working properly in just over a year.  In fact, for about 4 months out of that first year, I didn't even use it right after I had my son.  That was way too short of a time and too much money spent on an item that wasn't working properly.<br /><br />I am very diasspointed with this and will NEVER buy anything by this company ever again.<br /><br />If you need a good hairdryer, look elsewhere.

After trying out at least 5 other dryers, I found this to be BY FAR the best for the money. It is relatively quiet for the airflow it produces- no hi-pitched whine like some other models. And it is VERY POWERFUL! It is heavier than others, but I don't mind getting a little extra muscle tone. It doesn't have a shiny plastic finish and can withstand being dropped many times on a tile bathroom floor-- trust me.<br /><br />I have long, fine hair that will get unruly and curly against my wishes unless dried a certain way. The high blower setting with medium heat works great for me, plus I use the cold shot and a big roller brush to create volume.

This works as well as any $100 dryer as far as I'm concerned.

She has extremely thick hair and drying it takes a very long time.   After purchasing the T3 from an authorized dealer, I found the Good Housekeeping review that gave a favorable review of the Revlon Tourmaline Ionic. Since the Revlon is 1/10th the cost, I bought one at Target and gave both to my wife for Christmas.      I was hoping that she would find the Revlon comparable and we could save the expense of the T3.  No such luck.  She first used to T3 and found that it was much quieter than her current dryer and that it reduced the time it took to dry her hair by about 10 minutes.  When she next used the Revlon, she ended up burning her hair and refuses to ever use it again.  She's been using the T3 for about three weeks as remains very happy with it.     Being the more analytical one, I decided to do a scientific comparison between the two.  Note that I only had one sample of each dryer and I didn't use calibrated instruments, so these observations are only useful in comparing the two samples that I had.     The first and most important difference concerned the temperature of the air exiting these two dryers while set for high output and hot temperature.  The T3 held a fairly consistent temperature that most of the time fell between 190 and 210 degrees.  Extremes fell between 180 and 230 degrees, but these were for only a second or two before the temperature returned to 200+/-10 degrees.      The Revlon was much less consistent.  Its temperature continuously fluctuated between 130 and 235 degrees. Once I observed the temperature spike to almost 260 degrees.  I must have been one of these spikes the burned my wife's hair.  I took measurements over three different periods and noticed wide fluctuation during each one.  Keep in mind that I only had one sample of each dryer so these problems may be caused by a defective unit and not indicative of the entire line.      Both dryers are very quietcompared to those that my wife has used in the past.  The T3 ran at about 100 decibels at the intake and output ends and about 90 decibels on the side. From one foot away, the dryer ran from 78 to 84 decibels.   The Revlon was a little louder, running about 105db at the ends to 90db on the side.  From one foot, it in ranged from 82-89 decibels.  These measurements were taken in our bathroom which has almost no sound absorption.      The Revlon did push out more air.  On the high settings, the air exiting the Revlon had almost twice the force of that of the T3.   On the low setting, T3 had about 75% of the force of the Revlon.      Bottom line:  The Revlon had temperature problems and burned my wife's hair.  If that could be fixed, it would be a great dryer as it's 1/10 the cost on the T3.  But, right now, there's no way my wife is going to give up her T3.",1/13/2008,5,5.0

However, an Andrew Jackson will get you the Conair 209R Ion Shine 1875 watt hair dryer from Amazon.com, and your even have some change left over!  This dryer produces an impressive jet stream of air, with a selection of 3 heat settings.  The technical specifications boast Clouds of negatively-charged ions neutralize positive charges that are in the air and reduce the static electricity that causes fly-away frizzies and dulls hair.  Well, I don't know what all of that means but I will admit that my hair is not frizzy after using this dryer.  There is also a cold-shot button, which quickly removes heat from the air output, which is a great feature.  The dryer has a little weight to it, but it is not bulky and seems to be balanced quite well.  All hair dryers are fairly noisey but this Conair 209R Ion Shine is quieter than most of my previous dryers.<br /><br />One of my favorite features of this model, the built-in cord retractor, seems to be getting negative comments from other reviewers here on Amazon.  Common sense tells me that I should hold onto the heavy power adapter with one hand while holding in the cord release buttong with the other.  You easily control the retraction speed this way, which prevents the end from whipping around as most people are complaining about.  It's really not a big deal and doesn't take much effort on the user's part.<br /><br />I do wish that this dryer had three air speed settings, since high is sometimes too harsh, and the low setting is usually too soft.

My wife's habit of leaving her non-hanging dryer and tangle of cords all over the sink and vanity motivated me to get a replacement fast!    The dryer does its job -- drying -- very well.  The compact handset is easy to maneuver and it puts out a surprisingly high volume of air at the right temperature, which is a must for those with long or extra-thick hair.    This is the smallest unit of its kind I've seen.  The mounting bracket is barely wider than the dryer, which makes putting it into tight places a snap.    The relatively minor disadvantages have to do with the installation.  First, the power cord length cannot be adjusted.  It is one continuous cord from the bottom of handset, through the mounting bracket, and down to the GFCI power plug.  Some competing dryers have an electrical junction in the bracket which allows you to shorten the wire running from the bracket to the wall outlet and makes for a neater, tangle-free installation.  Second, and this is a quibble, the enclosed mounting screws and wall anchors are pretty flimsy.  I substituted a better pair I had sitting around in my toolbox.

It's performance is decent (dries hair quickly with less frizz), but it's design and construction leave something to be desired.    Issues:  1) It's really heavy so be prepared for your arm to get a work-out when using it.  2) The placement of the cord retractor button is really bad. If you set the dryer down on it's side sometimes the retractor button will get bumped causing your dryer to slide across the counter.  3) About 1 month ago the on/off button popped off. I was able to stick it back on, but it will occasionally still fall off during use.  4) The cord retractor is somewhat dangerous and also will get stuck occasionally during cord retraction.  5) The placement of the cool shot requires you to hold the dryer awkwardly to keep from accidentally pressing it.    Maybe it's just a matter of preference in design, but this dryer has been  very awkward and difficult for me to use.

R2S40H3M4ZQT6O,52809559,194533684,5,79,N,True,85,Best Hair Dryer Ever,"I have fine, wavy, fly-away hair that is prone to bushing and frizzing even in non-humid weather and until I found this dryer nothing could smooth, straighten and calm down this wild animal on my head!    This dryer is like a miracle!  Even in hot, humid weather I can walk outside and not feel my hair shrivel and kink up.  OK, there will be a little frizz, but not anywhere near as much as before.  I'm telling you, if this dryer can work this well on my hair it can work for anyone.  I've tried other expensive dryers that women rave about and they were all a waste of money compared to this one.    First of all, let me warn you that if you are expecting this dryer to be anything like your old dryer you are going to be let down.  In just about every way this dryer makes you think it's not up to the task but if you give it a chance you'll see that it is light years better than anything else out there.    For instance, this dryer does not seem to put out a lot of air.  People tend to think it doesn't have enough power but that's not because it isn't working, it's because it doesn't need to blow your hair to smithereens in order to dry it quickly and thoroughly.  And the benefits from not having to deal with all that wind are amazing.  It actually gives you better control over your hairstyle and doesn't poof up your hair.  If you curl your hair around a barrel brush and pull it tight, then pull verrry slowly down to the ends while following it with the dryer, it will dry your hair far more efficiently and smoothly than if you had to deal with tons of wind blowing your hair all over the place.  The only thing is that it takes some getting used to the lack of wind because you are forced to handle your hair differently.  Once you get the knack of it, though, you will never want to go back to your old dryer again.  I feel so much less stressed out using this dryer, too.  It's quieter, lighter and doesn't require gymnastics to achieve amazing results.    Another thing is thatthe dryer is amazingly light - it weighs just over half a pound!  Again, the control this affords you in being able to hold the dryer at strange angles indefinitely without feeling awkward or tired is amazing.  I used to think that only a professional could dry the hair on the back of my head and style it well, but now I can do it myself to perfection with this dryer.  This dryer is so easy to use you will have more energy when you leave the bathroom.  I'll swear it takes less time to dry my hair, although I haven't estimated by how much.  It feels like it takes about 25% less time than my old dryer, which was also a professional ionic/ceramic dryer.     One thing that is strange about this dryer (but not in a bad way) is that at first I thought I was seeing smoke rising from my hair when I used it.  This alarmed me because I thought I was damaging my hair.  Now I realize that this is most likely the humidity being blown out of my via the miracle of modern science!  It has no smell and it seems like water vapor.  I had seen this effect a bit with my old dryer, but it happens a LOT with this dryer.  All I know is that my hair comes out silky, smooth, and since I've been using it, in MUCH better condition than before.  I sometimes feel like I've used a relaxer on my hair!    The only complaint I have about this dryer is a small one and quite minor in the scheme of things.  The control buttons are in an awkward place on the grip of the handle and it is easy to accidentally turn the dryer off or change the speed or temperature.  There are 2 independent speed controls and 3 temperature controls.    Other than that, I find the lower speed virtually unecessary because the higher speed is versatile enough to use for any purpose.    In general, I would highly recommend this dryer to anyone regardless of their hair issues.  I often see women with thick curly hair act as if their hair type is the hardest to handle and if a dryer can work on them it can work on anyone.  Well, they never had fine, fly-away, kinky, curly, bushy, virtually weightless hair that will not be tamed for love or money like I do, so I often wonder just who has it harder in that department!  But regardless of that, I think that anyone who wants silkier, smoother, straighter hair will be more than happy with their results with this dryer.  Personally, when I have seen bad reviews of this dryer I think it's because the person hasn't learned how to use it yet and is expecting it to act like the average hair dryer.  If you have that reaction I would suggest taking some lessons in blow drying techniques because I am pretty sure that will solve your problem.  This dryer has taught me so much about how to dry my hair successfully that I am almost in debt to it for an education as well.  Now if they can only come out with a model that will shine shoes too!  ;-)    UPDATE May, 2008:  I have now owned this blow dryer for about a year and despite daily use it's still going strong with absolutely NO issues whatsoever and I am still thrilled with its performance!",6/15/2007,5,5.0

It has two settings: Low and High.  I use High almost exclusively, even though I have fine, short, grey hair because I don't like to dawdle over grooming in the morning.  Its dual voltage selections (125V/250V) would come in handy if travelling (with an added plug adapter).  High produces a rapid stream of air that quickly heats up and stays at a steady, moderately high temperature.  Low is appropriate if you spend more time styling with some degree of heat--producing a nice smooth and fuller result.  However, I'm a Type-A character who wants the job done pronto, so this is my machine of choice.  All dryers sound a little loud right in your own ear, but a family member says that the Andis is quieter than the Sunbeam I recently replaced.<br /><br />I bought this device to replace a Sunbeam compact dryer, which replaced another Sunbeam, which was preceded by at least two Conairs, and a parade of various compact (mostly) dryers over the last 32 years.

I was a bit hesitant to order it given some of the reviews, but when it was discounted on a Friday Sale, I figured I'd give it a shot.

It clearly states that you should not leave water in the reservoir (why you would want to anyway is beyond me - why would anyone want to use stale water?). If you don't leave water in it, it won't leak out on your counter. Pretty simple equation there.<br /><br />I agree with several others that the tongue cleaning attachments are basically useless. They don't fit into the holder anyway, so just toss them out. Sure, try it, but I'll bet you'll find it to be basically useless compared with a true tongue cleaner (i.e., a scraper type device).<br /><br />The water reservoir could be a bit bigger - an additional 20% bigger would be nice. But, it's very easy to fill even when the unit is running (keep a glass of water handy and just pour it in when the water level is at the half-way point). Simple and easy, and the smaller reservoir does have the benefit of keeping the unit size nice and compact.<br /><br />Sound level is very low compared with past WaterPik units. No, it's not silent, but it is no more noise than you would get with any other electric appliance in the bathroom such as an electric toothbrush or a shaver.

The results have been nothing short of miraculous. <br /> <br />I take this toothbrush everywhere I can and the charge tends to last several days before recharging is needed. At any rate, I suppose the only shortcoming of this toothbrush lies in the problems encountered when traveling a lot: The base station is simply too bulky to conveniently pack away and take with you.

My hairdresser who uses this dryer daily had recommended it to me awhile back.

While very light weight and space-saving, I soon learned after several months of frequent use that either the cord was going to fray from from the retracting into the handle or worse, the handle could break from folding.  Well, it did.  After the handle broke, I decided to purchase this hair dryer and I regret not having done so sooner.  What a great hairdryer - very lightweight, dries hair quickly to a smooth satiny shine.  I have straight, medium length, medium thickness hair that usually would take at least 45 minutes to dry.  Well, the T3 cut the drying time to 14 minutes and that's taking my time. The T3 dryer is also very quiet and despite having only 2 speeds and a cold shot button, does the job quite nicely and I don't miss having all of the other speeds.

I thought I had the perfect blow dryer because it did what it was supposed to do and quickly. Now for the bad news:  the retractable cord became chewed up and frayed after daily use and it became apparent that the cord was ultimately going to fray completely in due time. Then, the folding handle, low and behold, broke in half one morning. (Of course, the warranty had long expired). This dryer is too fragile to consider using on a daily basis and I consider myself a careful person when it comes to handling small appliances such as hair dryers. When I've replaced hair dryers in the past, it was been because they've simply reached the end of their lifespans and burned out.  I'd caution anyone to consider this before buying because these 2 features alone, while very appealing, can shorten an otherwise good hairdryer's lifespan.

The hair dryer dries my hair in about 6 minutes (when it is wet from the shower)- I have asian hair so I can say that drying my hair isn't always a positive experience. However, if you dry your hair with the hot option first (doing the layers), then on the low option for the roots of your hair, and finishing with a blast of cool air all over, you will have shiny hair that is not poofy and is manageable.  <br />After using my t3 hair dryer, I don't know how I could not have it. Now, I want to get the overnight dryer. However, here is a warning. DO NOT EXPECT MIRACLES! If you have super frizzy hair or completely unmanageable hair, a hair dryer will not fix that.

At home I had the Sharper image 1875W quiet Ionic hair dryer and this is what I am comparing it to. I went thru two of the Sharper images ones (first one broke) which are much more expensive and my biggest complaint always was that it scorched my head.<br /><br />Problems gone since I bought this. It is an awesome hair dryer. It lays in your hands comfortably, is sturdy and stores away in a breeze as it folds in the middle, plus you can retract the cord. On top of that it does not scorch or burn your head and also has the cool air feature (same as the Sharper Image) and my hair comes out nice, soft and never frizzy. At a price between $18 and $22 this is the hair dryer to buy. I did, and only wish I had known about this hair dryer earlier. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Update on 9/26/2009: Almost 3 years later we're still on the same hair dryer. The cord needs a little help to retract but nothing has given up on it yet. It has been dropped a few times too. For the price that is excellent and we have purchased a second unit for our other bathroom. Much better than the Sharper image version which is way more expensive, scorches your head and won't last long.<br /><br />Update 06/30/2016: the hair dryer is still going strong, cable retracting mechanism is broken now but that was not why we bought it in the first place.

The air diffusing attachment is perfect for creating soft, frizz free curls while the concentrator nozzle (more narrow and therefore a better conductor of air than most models with this feature) allows you to direct air exactly where you want it.  The dryer itself features two speed (low and high) and three heat settings (cool, warm and hot), as well as a cold shot button to lock in style.  For the highest heat setting, simply put the dryer on high speed and the hottest setting (careful, though...this is only recommended for hair that's UBER curly, like mine).  Additionally, the 9 foot long cord (complete with a loop that will allow you to hook it onto something in your bathroom or wherever else you store it) makes it really easy to use.  Another bonus: even on the highest setting, the dryer is considerably more quiet than other ones on the market that are similarly priced (you can easily hold a conversation while speaking in a normal tone of voice). <br /> <br />According to the information that's included with the product, the dryer is made with a combination pink tourmaline/ceramic technology that allows for a special emission of ions (these are important for eliminating static electricity).  I found that after use, my hair actually was a lot smoother even than when I used previous hair dryers with ionic technology; I used it to style my hair both in its naturally curly state and after setting it in rollers to blow dry it straight.  If your hair is really curly like mine, however, you might still want to use a flatiron to get that pin-straight look.  But for less curly hair or hair that's less prone to frizz, that probably won't be necessary. <br /> <br />Although this is by far my favorite hair dryer I've ever owned, I do agree with the previous comment on this product: it really would be the perfect dryer if it had a folding handle.  But this is only a tiny flaw, as it more than makes up for that missing feature with its humidity resisting technology.  Well done, Remington.

I have generally been very pleased with Conair hair dryers, and the Ion feature seems to really tame the frizz.  However, the blower on this model is very slow, so it takes a long time.  Sometimes I have to pull out my old dryer to get the wet out, then use this one to finish -- otherwise it would take me 20 minutes to dry my hair.  Also, the high/low setting is for the blower only, which is useless since high is so slow anyway.  The heat is not controlable, except for the COLD button you have to hold down to get just air.  As other reviewers have noted, the buttons are terrible.  I almost can't hold it by the handle without turning it off.  Occasionally I have gotten through with drying and realized the Ion feature got turned off -- how annoying, especially after having spent 20 minutes drying my hair.",11/3/2004,5,4.0

When my old Hartman Protech 1600 hair dryer hit the bathroom floor, things weren't the same. Eventually, in a spectacular pyrotechnic display, it breathed its last.<br />Since I had paid 20 bucks for it way back when, I was ready to spend that much on a replacement. Much to my surprise, in the 10 or so years I'd owned that dryer, a lot had changed, and now the same money buys a lot more hair dryer, so with some dough to spare, I bought one of these.<br />Many complain that it doesn't pack the same wallop as other dryers but that's a case of perception versus reality. The Conair's barrel has a larger diameter than most dryers and its fan is quieter, so while the perceptible breeze isn't as blustery, it's still moving plenty of air. I know because I use an egg timer to count off 3 minutes while I dry my hair and the Conair never leaves my hair damp (a barber told me that after 3 minutes of blow drying, you're just toasting your hair and not helping it). If you MUST have that scalp-scorching pinpoint blast, Conair includes a concentrator.<br />Ions are all the rage in hair dryer technology right now. Purportedly, a stream of ions directed at your hair will neutralize static electricity and smooth out frizzy hair. Ions are also claimed to flatten out scaly hair shafts, resulting in more shine. I'm waiting for our good friends at Consumer Reports to weigh in on the benefits (or lack thereof) of dual ion ports, but after a week of daily use with the ion switch ON, I've noticed that my hair doesn't fight me as much when I brush it into place. Even when the static-charged Santa Ana winds are howling through sunny SoCal, my hair doesn't stick out like porcupine quills. And, yes, if I turn my head from side to side, there's a noticeable shimmer that either wasn't there before or I had never noticed it.<br />A minor flaw is that the power and ion switches respond to a very light push, but after a couple uses you learn to position your hand accordingly after switching on the dryer. The dryer offers low and high air-speed/heat settings and has a cool shot button that cuts off the heater while cranking the fan up to its fastest speed. Cool shot is another feature that is said to set a style in place by cooling down the hair quickly.<br />So, whether ions really do or don't make a difference, the overall performance of the Conair Ion Shine is worth the price.ut after a couple uses you learn to position your hand accordingly after switching on the dryer.

My hair much is smoother, shinier and the (split) ends lay flat with the Revlon ION. My hair doesn't feel like it's parched compared to when I use the SSX.  Yes, it's not an expensive professional dryer so it may not last as long as the SSX (I won't know because I won't be using the SSX any longer) but it makes my hair look 100% better after it's dried than the professional dryer does and it's a much quicker, healthier dry time.  I receive compliments on my hair when I have used the Revlon ION dryer, and needless to say, no compliments on my hair when I have used the SSX.

I have long, naturally curly, thick hair that I like to wear very straight to the office. Both my expensive hair dryer and this hair dryer get my hair straight and very smooth. The best method for achieving this was to use the highest heat and fastest setting on wet hair until the hair is damp, then to finish drying my hair with the air-flow nozzle on low speed and medium heat while using a rollerbrush to hold the hair straight and curl the ends.         I'd highly recommend this hair dryer. One thing to note: I do not notice any difference when using the ion switch (depends on hair type?).

It was slightly less noisy, but at a different pitch (it seemed a little higher pitched).       The only thing that prevents me from giving a five-star rating is that it seemed to take a little longer to dry my hair than with my previous dryer, which was the same wattage.
