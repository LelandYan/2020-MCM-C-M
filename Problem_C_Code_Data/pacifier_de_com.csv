None of the other brands came close to this size and they drew up substantially in the wash on the first washing. Not so with these Carter blankets. They can handle multiple washings with little shrinkage.<br /><br />I don't know about you but receiving blankets take some abuse here.

(the one that comes with it no longer works for us as when in place it pulls my daughters long legs tight against the stroller which obviously she hates.)  this xl stroller has a longer than average  stroller canopy so i have found most generic weather shields are too short over the top resulting in the shield looking odd (as the corners aren't on the corners at all but up an inch on to the roof of the stroller hood) & consequently losing inches in length of coverage for the front.  (jeep standard stroller weather shield does just this and is also very flimsy.  ripped at one joint first time i put it on!) this shield just about works.  i have found that if you attach from the second set of velcro fastenings down it will do a passable job of fitting.  it has a longer front than any other i have tried and finishes only  2-3 inches away from the foot support. it also seems quite sturdy, unlike the jeep cover it doesn't feel like it will rip at the seams. i have no doubts it will flap around a bit in the wind (although it is anchored well around the back of the stroller with decent velcro fastenings) but as i'm more concerned about rain this is fine for me.  all in all i think this is a good shield for the price.",3/7/2013,5,5.0,1,1,100.0

We needed a stroller that would travel well without sacrificing all features, like most umbrella strollers. Our usual stroller is a Britax b ready, so this is a huge difference.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Assembly was easy- all wheels come unattached, as well as the umbrella.<br />The recline option is easy to work, no different really than tightening the bottom of a coat.<br />Handles are comfortable to hold and seem to be a perfect height (5'8&#34;). I suspect others that will use it that are much taller will be comfortable as well.<br />The cup holder! There is a storage sack/built in cup holder affixed to the top<br />Large umbrella with matching dot trim covers significant area<br />Storage basket seems large enough to hold a diaper bag and coat<br /><br />No Cons as of yet.<br /><br />I second that this is the same as the Ignite stroller by the First Years. I gave significant consideration to purchasing that instead, but the brand is really a moot point for this to me. The product registration form even references that this is an Ignite model. Price point was about $15 less to go with this model vs the Ignite.<br /><br />Lastly, the colors are much more muted than pictured- I was concerned that the stroller looked girly, but honestly the colors are gender neutral.

[[asin:b0092kszxs stroller click'n move 3 (cranberry)]]<br /><br />  i love the black frame. you can also get a black frame with the color \\stone\\ or \\cranberry\\ fabric. and there are two silver frames offered, with black, or \\walnut\\ fabrics. notice the nice padded harness, by the way, to protect those tender little shoulders from getting chafed.  the click n move 3 has three recline positions.this is pretty flat, but you can also buy the kiddy carrycot if you like. it's so cute!<br />[[asin:b00crm5kw2 carrycot kiddy click'n move 3 (stone)]]<br /><br />  just above this zippered pocket, on the back, is a black metal recline bar. you squeeze it, and down goes the seat. there's a napper bar, if your child likes to sit up, and pull themselves forward. but it has another function as well. what lies beneath it? ding ding! you got it! (or you saw my preview, on strollerqueen.com). well if you did, you read that this is one of my favorite features. you unzip this cover, and,ta da! instant rain protection! ahhhh-mazing! (the napper bar also swings out, or pops off if you want to remove it completely.)i'm such a stroller geek when it comes to innovation. but what a great idea.the raincover is always there, so you are always covered. literally.<br /><br />  as i mentioned earlier, the basket is covered, too. there is a canvas flap that you can completely zip up all the way, to protect all of your belongings from the elements, or prying eyes. more features include an adjustable handlebar,suspension on the wheels, which are easy to remove, by the way, a big brake in the center, that is very easy, and obvious, to use, a comfy, adjustable leg rest, and an oversized canopy with a covered peekaboo window.<br /><br />  the seat is super easy to reverse. you just pull up the two side levers, and it lifts right out.the fold is pretty neat. i like the way it self stands. basically you just pull up the levers on the handlebar, then grasp the lower handle and it slides down.in conclusion, i would say that the click n' move 3 is a well thought out, packed with features stroller that comes in at a good price. worth a try. and it will leave you high and dry!",11/13/2013,3,4.0,1,1,0.0

219546688,r7d1tqvjwqq8p,32107149,219546688,5,36,n,True,38,perfect!  better than medela and lansinoh bags.,"these bags made all of my wildest breastmilk pumping and storing dreams come true!  i would give them 6 or 7 stars.<br /><br />they combine all of the good features of the other brands into one product, with none of the flaws that the other products have.<br /><br />i love these bags!<br /><br />okay, so here's the low down on these:<br /><br />- this is the new version of honeysuckle's breastmilk bags, which are designed to be used with a pump--you just pump right into them.<br /><br />the bags have little holes on the top part, so that you can attach them to a pump adapter.  so, for the full experience, you need a pump adapter or two, which you can get by purchasing a pack of bags made by your pump's manufacturer.  i bought these medela bags: [[asin:b007pexokw medela pump & save breastmilk bags with easy-connect adapter - 50 ct]] because i have a medela pump.  i don't know if adapters are interchangeable between brands.  then, use the medela bags if you want, so that you're not wasting, and so that you know how wonderful these honeysuckle bags are when you start using them.  whether or not you use the bags, keep the little plastic adapters.<br /><br />then get some of these honeysuckle breast pump bags, and you'll see how perfect they are.<br /><br />medela vs. honeysuckle<br />all right, so here are the reasons that i like this bag better than the medela bags:<br />1. the plastic is not as rigid as the medela bags, yet it is still thick enough that you don't have to worry about it.<br />2. get this: the honeysuckle bags fit the medela easy adapter better than the medela bags do!  with the medela bags, you have to put them on at just the right angle, and it's kind of a tight fit.  then removing the bags after you've pumped is...well, interesting.  the honeysuckle bags are easy to put on, and they still stay put while you're pumping, but then they are easy to remove when you're done.<br />3. the honeysuckle bags can be stored flat in the freezer so that it is easier to store more, instead of having a bunch of squatty bags like the medela ones.  or, you can store them upright if you prefer.  another nice thing about storing them flat is that they defrost more quickly when you're ready to use them.<br />4. the honeysuckle bags can fit more milk.  they are marked to 6 oz (medela is marked to 5 oz), but since they can be stored flat, there is also just a bunch of extra space.  so, if you fill a little more it doesn't create any problem.  the medela bags get kind of messy if you put any more than 5 oz.<br />5. the honeysuckle bags have two seals.  medela only has one, and it doesn't always seal perfectly.<br />6. the honeysuckle bags are much, much less expensive than medela bags: right now (based on the cost of packs of 50 bags on amazon) honeysuckle bags are about 23 cents each and medela bags are 40 cents each.  so, medela bags are almost double the cost of honeysuckle bags.<br /><br />those are the things that come to mind.<br /><br />lansinoh vs. honeysuckle<br />1. the lansinoh bags cannot attach to a pump directly.  so, you either have to pump into something else first or hold the bag the whole time you pump.<br />2. the seams on the lansinoh bags are thin--honeysuckle's seams are very thick, so you really don't have to worry about them splitting at all.<br />3. lansinoh bags are meant to be stored flat, which is great, but they are awkward to try to stand up (when you're filling them or actually using them). honeysuckle bags can also be stored flat, but they have a special bottom of the bag that makes it so that it can stand up well too.<br />4. lansinoh bags are partially sealed at the top, which is supposed to reassure us that the bags are sterile.  honeysuckle bags are completely sealed at the top, which is much more reassuring.<br />5. the label area on lansinoh bags is upside down (so that they are right-side up while in the freezer, maybe?).  regular honeysuckle bags have the writing right-side up, which i think is nice---but! these pump bags have no writing, so you can do your own thing, and if you want to put it right-side up or upside down, either will work.<br />6. lansinoh bags are considered the cheap brand; right now on amazon each bag works out to about 21 cents.  at only 23 cents each right now, honeysuckle bags are very comparable in price, while the quality is far superior.<br /><br />i am aware that there are a few other brands of bags out there, but i haven't tried them.  i started with medela bags, switched to lansinoh but didn't even finish the package of those, switched back to medela, started buying non-pump honeysuckle bags--which are also very good, and just heard about these.  i won't be switching brands again, because i can't think of anything i would want to be different.<br /><br />if you're considering these bags, i definitely recommend that you buy them.  you won't regret it.  the only thing that is kind of a pain about them is that they are not available in any stores near me, so i have to get them online.  that just means i have to plan ahead a little, but i can handle that.  every time i order bags from honeysuckle (this was my third order), i have received them within a few days, so shipping time is also minimal.ice---but!

A straightforward and excellent budget product.,"[[VIDEOID:9754c0461ea0f5471aae69bdf21f5510]] This video is a very quick look (less than 2 minutes) at this camera and its monitor. I include an actual demo of its use in a dark room, stepping outside, and turning the lights off. It works exactly as advertised. The Foscam FBM2307 is NOT meant to be a high end, internet monitoring, SD card recording, remote controlled pan and tilt baby monitor. It has NONE of those features by design. There is no SD slot, there is no USB slot. By design. If you want those features, just look elsewhere. But as an excellent stand-alone baby monitor (or cat monitor, or front desk monitor) this works fine. I found the range to be outstanding - I left it in my office and made it about 200 feet away and down the stairs before the monitor lost contact with the camera (YMMV). Also, the clarity of the video and sound monitoring gave me nothing to complain about. This would be easy to throw in a bag or purse and take with you when you're travelling. It comes with two individual power supplies for the camera (which MUST be plugged in) and the monitor (which has a rechargeable battery and can be used remotely, but CAN be used plugged in). Overall it has a nice, solid feel. I confess to being a fan of budget products which work well. This is spot on in that category.<br /><br />Sample provided.",12/23/2014,5,5.0,1,0,100.0

They have a pricey 25% restocking fee but after reading up on the 20 wheel double jogger, I felt the great write ups and the good deal they offered outweighed the risk of return. Was a little confusing to set up at first until I realized most of what the instructions said to do was already done. Pretty much just had to slide a couple of frame pieced together and pop the wheels on. Took the 16 month old twins out for a test drive. You very much get what you pay for! <br />Great lightweight stroller for running with the kiddies! Holds the road true and bends and sways a little with you and the road (a good thing). Our neighbor gave us their old InStep which they've outgrown and it pulled to the right, and was just not comfortable for running. While it's also great for walking (I also put a CD player in the under basket with Vivaldi's Four Seasons or something else calming for the kids like George Winston) if that's all one is going to do then one of those cheaper strollers with the flimsey swivel front wheel may be the better way to go. But if you're going to run some of the time with it, this is the best we've checked out. I assume the kids like it also as they were out in minutes. <br />Lighweight, holds the road great, I set the tires at about 43 lbs (40 to 65lb range) and the ride/run was comfy.

337883289,r3rse7ve043cnl,32080670,337883289,5,49,n,True,51,love this swing,"i bought a second hand swing at a thrift store and used it every day for about a month before the motor died; our baby loves to swing for naps and when i'm showering, cooking or otherwise can't hold her.  i immediately began researching for a new swing and ordered this one sunday night.  the swing arrived the following friday afternoon. she and we love this swing!       our baby is 12 lbs, 24 inches, 11 weeks old.  the seat is deep so we have to put a little pillow in the bottom for her to sit on, otherwise she slides forward and is too slumped to be comfortable.  i'm glad the swing is deep because she'll be able to use it as she grows.  i've read reviews that said the tray is hard to open and makes a loud noise; i find the tray easy to open with one hand and it's very quiet if you're careful.  if you're in a hurry it does make a snapping sound as it clicks into place.  we ditched the mobile because it interferes with the swinging arm (as someone else noted in his review) and the toys are directly over the baby's head where she can't see them anyway.  will have to think of a solution when baby really starts noticing toys.    the swing has 6 settings; we use the high setting to calm her and help her get to sleep as recommended by dr.karp in \\happiest baby on the block\\, then put the swing on a low setting while she sleeps.  the swing has a timer option but if you don't use the timer, it doesn't automatically shut off as other swings do. we like that it works continuously since she sleeps in the swing at night (right beside my side of the bed where i hear her every sniff and sigh). she was sleeping five hours at a time in her co-sleeper but in the swing she sleeps up to 12 hours with one night-time feeding.       i feel comfortable letting her sleep in the swing since we swaddle her tightly (also rec. by karp) and the swing is deep as noted above.  we don't use the complicated 5 point straps since we swaddle her and use the tray for restraint.  even when she isn't swaddled we feel safe leaving her unstrapped (with an adult monitoring in the same room) and she is very active--always kicking and flailing her arms while awake.  she can't turn herself over yet though, so we may have to use the straps later.  another reason we feel safe letting her sleep in the swing is that even with poor neck strength at this age, her head doesn't flop forward even on the highest setting.  i haven't had to adjust the swing back so can't comment on that; when we first put it together she reclined nicely in it.     i'm thrilled so far with the battery life.  we've been using the swing every day and night for nine days now; we frequently use the high setting and the batteries show no sign of slowing.    others have commented that the music is boring and \\nature sounds\\ are horrible.  they are.  we don't use the music since she doesn't seem to care about it and we'd be better off turning on a cd of classical music instead.  we don't use the nature sounds either since we use a floor fan for white noise that she likes, but in defense of graco (whether they planned this or not) karp points out that babies love white noise which is what the \\nature sounds\\ sound like.  white noise is similar to what baby hears in the womb--a loud shhhhhh as blood rushes through mother's circulatory system.     the swing is very quiet even on the high setting; as i said she sleeps in it beside me and i'm a light sleeper.      while the swing is bulky, i'm still able to pick it up and move it daily from bedroom to living room to kitchen without too much trouble.  it's bulky but not heavy.  the legs do fold for storage.    so the cons for us---mobile is useless, have to push \\off\\ button up to six times to get the swing to stop swinging, straps are laughably complicated---maybe to prevent older children from removing baby before mom has a chance to notice??  maybe to prevent lawsuits??        pros for us---deep, large, comfy seat; weight limit 30lbs instead of more common 25lbs; removable head immobilizer; quiet, easy to open tray; quiet motor; great speed settings; sturdy frame; fairly easy to move around house; no automatic shut off; long battery life with frequent swing use; removable, washable swing cover; easy to put together (30 minutes tops); reliable name brand; price is great esp. with free super saver shipping; and of course the baby loves this swing!     if the swing ends up having a short lifetime, i'll update my review.",8/9/2008,5,5.0,1,1,100.0

We are still using it three years on with our second child. Folding is about as simple as it gets and it pretty much lives in the back of our Prius with decent room left over for bags and groceries. Nothing has broken on it. There are a LOT of more expensive strollers and combi systems, but I'm not really sure what they could do any better. This one hits the real sweet spot. Most other similar strollers with an infant seat system are either quite a bit heavier, or much more expensive - or both. There are lighter strollers - but do they work with an infant carrier type car seat?  What we really wanted was a combi system (stroller/car seat) that was light enough for my wife to lift and put in the trunk. Most of the combi strollers we looked at were more like 25-30 pounds. This is only 17 lbs. Believe me, it makes a difference when you lug these things around 4-5 times a day for a few years.   This works perfectly with the matching SnugRide infant seat. That comes with a detachable base, you can easily get extra bases for different cars. And everything is priced very reasonably.   I don't know if this is still the best on the market at this point, but it's been great for us. I guess my advice would be - look at the stroller weight before you buy anything, and try to get something less than 20 lbs.",12/4/2011,5,5.0,1,1,100.0

Obviously I paid way more at the specialty store where I bought it. I have now chosen this set for my baby girl due in June. The most awesome thing about her sets is the 4 pc. slipcovered bumpers. I have looked everywhere and cannot find any other manufacturer who offers this. So the colors aren't EXACTLY what I was hoping for--so what! You need to think more about the functionality of your choices for baby's nursery more than the cosmetics, especially with more than one child. You may not appreciate it until your baby has their first bout with a stomach virus--some of you know what I mean! It is so convenient to be able to unzip the slipcovers off the bumper and throw them in the washer & dryer without ruining your entire crib bumper. It's also great if you need to wash only one section. Also, when your child gets too tall for a bumper, you can simply remove the section(s) where they could use it to climb out. My son is huge for 15 mos. and loves to use the 3 sections of the bumper still in his crib as pillows to lay on. The quality is excellent and this set will outlast the time your child is in the crib. If you don't like the feel of the sheet, go out and buy some extra sheets that coordinate with the set (that's what I did the first time). I feel there is no better choice than Wendy B. and we're lucky they're readily available at BRU vs. paying boutique pricing!",4/7/2005,5,5.0,1,0,100.0

(keep in mind, though, that it's designed around utility, so it's going to take a little longer than your average street stroller. the first time, as with most new gadgets, takes a bit longer, too.)<br /><br />• the cabin is very spacious, and will handily accommodate our child's long torso as he grows.<br /><br />• storage 'trunk' behind the seating and pockets in the cabin hold plenty. there's lots of foot room, so i often put things at my son's feet, too.<br /><br />• the rigid floor is excellent. it supports his feet and keeps his legs more comfortable than the soft-floored ones can.<br /><br />• the feature that i love most isn't mentioned in the manual at all, i assume for legal reasons. there are leg holes under the handle that render it into a shopping-cart-style seat, so when we're out for a long time, and my son has had enough of looking forward on his own, he can join me as i push it along. this feature alone is priceless. it has saved the day countless times already in the few months we've had it. there is no harness, so i am very careful, and i would never take my hands off it when he's there, but it is well designed. it seems insubstantial, but holds him very well. (it helps to have some cargo in the front, for balance.)<br /><br />• it is undeniably handsome. i probably wouldn't have chosen the bright yellow if there had been more options, but it is cheerful and easy to look at. it is also easy to see, which makes it safer.<br /><br />• it is vented. most of the time, we keep the bug screen and window open and stowed, so ventilation isn't much of an issue, but in rain or cooler weather, the vent underthe handle is terrific. to keep airflow going, i zip the window down on both sides, but tuck the bottom inch or two up next to the screen.<br /><br />cons:<br /><br />• soft seat means with two riders, they'll squish toward the middle. it's easy to fix by adding something rigid underneath. when his buddy comes along, that's what we do, and it works perfectly.<br /><br />• the back of a bike helmet pushes the child's head forward, which must be uncomfortable. i got no complaint from my little guy, but i'm thinking of a way to fix it, because it bugs me.<br /><br />• while i wouldn't call it heavy, i've seen other bike trailers out there that are tiny and look featherlight. anyone who spends much time on a bike knows how much weight matters. it's easy enough to haul around, but its features and size mean that it's no fun coming across  a stop sign when you're starting up a hill with two kids in the trailer.<br /><br />all in all, this is a superb piece of equipment.",8/17/2013,5,5.0,2,2,100.0

There's a range of products to help address this that fall into either slightly padded fabric type cover and some kind of foam/silicon based bumper. We didn't feel comfortable with baby biting synthetic materials so this cover while thin provides some bump protection but we feel much better about her possibly chewing at cloth than other materials.

(i did have to use a towel underneath to make the base level which was also the case with the air protect). the straps have yet to twist and my daughter's head rests in a comfortable position. the seat is very cushy yet supportive and the adjustable straps are definitely a plus.    this car seat is simply a cut above the rest. it has all of the best safety features with little extras (belly pad, recline lever, easy-remove seat cover, etc) that make it an easy seat to use and own. yes, it is heavy (21 pounds), but it weighs less than my daughter so that is not an issue for me. and yes, it is expensive but in my opinion a car seat is not an area to look for a bargain. i am very happy with this seat andam relieved that the stress of trying to find the perfect car seat for our daughter is over.",9/26/2010,5,5.0,1,1,100.0

848909954,R6C7MBZYG4HQ1,14983298,848909954,5,0,N,True,0,The pros far out-weigh the cons,"I bought this crib tent when my two year old started trying to get out of her crib.  Once she knew she could do it, bedtime became a nightmare.  I didn't think she was mature enough to stay in a toddler bed.  And I was having a terrible time sleeping myself worrying that she would get out of her crib and would have free rein in the house.  I was concerned by some of the reviews saying it was poorly constructed, but I was desperate.  I have to say I love it!  My daughter things it's great when I put her in it, she'll even lift the flap for me to zip it sometimes.  She fusses when it's time to lay down.  But that's the same with the tent or without.  She seems to fall asleep more quickly with the tent.  I'm guessing that's partly because she can't throw her comfort items (blanket, lovey and seahorse) out, and partly because she knows she really doesn't have another option.  Instead of trying to get out of the crib, she just lays down.  I will agree the instructions could be better.  It took me longer than I would have liked to put it together. As for those with the zipper troubles, I almost wonder if they had the velcro too tight.  I know the first couple of times I zipped and unzipped it, I was really concerned. (It was like zipping up luggage that was too full.) But when I loosened the velcro holding it to the front rail, the zipper action was much smoother.  I have only had it for 6 weeks.  So I can not speak to it's long term durability.  But so far I am pleased.  The biggest cons I have with this crib tent would be that the zipper is loud.  I usually take out her musical seahorse, and cover her up before I go to bed.  I try to be as quiet as I can, but it sometimes makes her stir.  Thankfully it hasn't woken her up yet.  The other con is using it with a video baby monitor. The mesh makes it hard for the monitor camera to see in the crib.  I had to move the camera several times before finding somewhere that gave me a reasonable view.  For us, the pros of this product far outweigh the cons. Sleep is a precious commodity at our house. It was worth every penny we paid for this crib tent for her to get better sleep, thereby allowing me to get better sleep.",12/4/2011,5,5.0,1,1,100.0

(not recommended).  i am not saying this to discourage you to buy this seat, rather i think you should educate yourself on how to put an infant into a car seat well in advance of the day you decide to take the baby home from the hospital!!!  since then, obviously we figured it out. and now we love this carseat.<br /><br />i own both the boulevard cs 70 and the marathon versions of the britax seats.  the boulevard is considerably more &#34;luxe&#34; than the marathon. i like that the seatbelt clicks. at first, i hated it because i felt like it was way too constricting when it squeezed against my baby. but now i feel like i need that comfort of the click to know the seat belt is on properly.  the marathon that i have does not have the click feature, and i never feel like it's on tight enough.<br /><br />we decided to not go with the infant carrier seat, and i am very happy with my decision to not get one (despite a lot of protests from my friends).  a few words of advice for those of you choosing to use only one convertible car seat from birth until they outgrow the seat...<br /><br />1.) newborns need a full recline! otherwise their heads roll forward and can constrict breathing.  we had to get towels and prop the seat up so that the seat would fully recline properly in our car<br /><br />2.) when the seat is rear facing, and in newborn recline mode, it may not fit in your car right. especially if you are tall people that require the driver seat and passenger seats pushed all of the way back.  my husband is 6'4&#34;.  this is a problem for us, because the seat couldn't recline completely and thus, the baby's neck was constricted.  we actually bought a new car all because of this!!! not exactly the most economical approach, but we wanted a new car anyhow.<br /><br />3.) the cushions are essential to get with your convertible car seat so that you can properly get a ball of a newborn baby to fit into the seat right.<br /><br />4.) i highly recommend getting one of those inserts that wraps around the baby's head so that the head doesn't fall from side to side.  that was a huge problem for me at first because of the lack of neck and head control in those first months.<br /><br />5.) if you are in a bumpy ride (think a jeep wrangler, or a sporty subaru impreza with stiff shocks), then don't get a seat like this for a newborn. their head is going to bounce all over the place in the car seat.<br /><br />6.) it takes some practice to maneuver the newborn into the car seat because of the lack of head control.  you have to sort of hold the baby horizontal, and slide them into the car seat sideways. it's annoying but possible.<br /><br />overall, it's possible to do this from birth on, but there are definitely considerations that need to be made when making that choice!",11/7/2013,4,4.0,1,1,0.0

 because of the metal legs that have to be attached and then that darn strap belt.<br /><br />the safety first bedrail is about four inches shorter than the regalo length wise, which isn't an issue for me.  the safety first is much shorter in height than the regalo, which i thought would be an issue but it isn't.  my son can climb over it when he's awake which isn't safe, but he doesn't thrash about where he would be lifted enough to fall over in his sleep.<br /><br />installing the safety first into the bed is so easy.  you just life the mattress and slide the legs under.  they have rubber grips on them so the legs don't slide out.  then you push the top of the tails down to snap them onto the mattress where you want them.  i had them too right at first and you just push the back buttons to release some of the tension.  one of our regalos lives on our master king bed for when the little one snuggles or falls asleep with us.  i can not tell you how hard it is to get the darn belt into the center under the mattress.  are the belts safer?  not in my opinion.  i have to tighten it all the time.  but the regalo is higher so that is nicer with the king size mattress.  so that being said, the safety first is a much easier install.<br /><br />with the safety first you lose about four inches of bed width because the rail is locked onto the mattress rather than the regalo that is on the side of the mattress.  i don't mind losing the bed space because there are no cracks for my little one to fall through.<br /><br />the safety first does not budge.  once locked on, i have pushed and pulled and that sucker is strong.  with the regalo i always have a crack that i have to wedge a pillow into so that my little one doesn't slip into it.  and he can push it pretty far out.  so annoying.<br /><br />making the beds.  the regalo stays on the king mattress when changing sheets but it's a pain.  it doesn't fold down like it's supposed to anymore so i have to work around it.  the safety first is so light and easy i take it off to change sheets.<br /><br />travel!  so my second regalo has been modified by me, regardless of safety warnings.  i wanted a bed rail for hotels and grandmas and the regalo was not like my old school one that just slid into the bed.  so i chopped off the belt and tossed it and my dad welded the bar to the legs.  it's clunky, but it works.  i know i'm not supposed to do that btw.  anyways, now i'm excited for our next trip to take this light weight, super easy no belt rail.  yeah!<br /><br />so yes, i like this product.  we have two beds that are just a mattress on a wood frame and it fits on them easily.  i don't have a pillow top so i'm not sure how it works on those.  i do have two memory foam mattresses that it works well on too.  you have to be careful not to make it too tight on the memory foam because these suckers can squeeze. with the regalo i had issues with the wood framed beds, it didn't fit into the wedges on both sides.<br /><br />also, please note this is just one bedrail.  but you could get one for each side if needed.<br /><br />rereading this i sound like a regalo hater and that's not entirely true.  like i said, they are longer and higher and are on the outside of the bed, so they are just a different type of rail.  for me personally i prefer the bedrails without the straps.with the regalo i always have a crack that i have to wedge a pillow into so that my little one doesn't slip into it.  and he can push it pretty far out.  so annoying.<br /><br />making the beds.  the regalo stays on the king mattress when changing sheets but it's a pain.  it doesn't fold down like it's supposed to anymore so i have to work around it.  the safety first is so light and easy i take it off to change sheets.<br /><br />travel!  so my second regalo has been modified by me, regardless of safety warnings.  i wanted a bed rail for hotels and grandmas and the regalo was not like my old school one that just slid into the bed.  so i chopped off the belt and tossed it and my dad welded the bar to the legs.  it's clunky, but it works.  i know i'm not supposed to do that btw.  anyways, now i'm excited for our next trip to take this light weight, super easy no belt rail.  yeah!<br /><br />so yes, i like this product.  we have two beds that are just a mattress on a wood frame and it fits on them easily.  i don't have a pillow top so i'm not sure how it works on those.  i do have two memory foam mattresses that it works well on too.  you have to be careful not to make it too tight on the memory foam because these suckers can squeeze. with the regalo i had issues with the wood framed beds, it didn't fit into the wedges on both sides.<br /><br />also, please note this is just one bedrail.  but you could get one for each side if needed.<br /><br />rereading this i sound like a regalo hater and that's not entirely true.  like i said, they are longer and higher and are on the outside of the bed, so they are just a different type of rail.  for me personally i prefer the bedrails without the straps.",10/7/2014,4,4.0,1,1,0.0
